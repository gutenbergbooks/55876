<p class="drop-cap noindent">THESE reminiscences of prison years
in Brussels, during the entire
German occupation, aim merely at giving
an accurate account of the city’s moral
atmosphere, and of certain events which
came to me first-hand and have not yet
been recorded. Only indubitable facts are
related, while many of, perhaps, greater
and more tragic interest, already made
public, or reaching me through roundabout
channels, have been omitted.</p>

<p>This slight record, which, in great part,
lay for many months buried under Belgian
soil, to escape German inquisition, may
appear an unnecessary addition to the
volumes of more important matter already
produced by the war. But as the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
States, after long-forgiving delay, entered
the conflict heart and soul—as England,
the land of my forefathers both paternal
and maternal, performed very miracles
and risked her all for a cause so great—it
seems my duty, as that of every eye-witness,
to give all positive evidence
possible, to those who must bear the
consequent taxation, that the cause was
worthy of the vast sacrifices it demanded.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">“THANK Heaven we are in a sane
country at last!” was my
thought when, after struggling as best we
could through terror-stricken France, my
companion and I crossed the Belgian
frontier early in August 1914.</p>

<p>Such was the impression made by the
calm confidence of a people already meeting
the German forces at the point where
their inadequately fortified boundaries
had been treacherously attacked. The
impression may have been partly due to
contrast with some days amid the wild
confusion and panic of Paris, where,
almost devoid of funds (since all letters
of credit were valueless), we had existed,
with several other stranded travellers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
on the charity, or rather faith, of a prominent
hotel proprietor. During that
never-to-be-forgotten sojourn in the famous
capital, we had witnessed something resembling
the frenzied excitement of revolution
days. The entire population,
expecting a repetition of the horrors of
1870, was in a fever of alarm; distraction
and tumult reigned on every
side. Streets rang night and day with
the hysterical cries of newsvendors announcing
some unlooked-for lightning
flash through the cloud of storm rapidly
spreading darkness over the world; echoed
to the ceaseless tramp of troops hurrying
to the front, and with the shrieks and
howls of applause raised by half-maddened
crowds thronging the thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Lightning alone can symbolize the rapid
shocks that reached us, almost hourly,
during those first days. But, as these
events are well known, and their recital
not an object of this account, they may be
left to the more able hands now, doubtless,
engaged in presenting them as each writer
deems advantageous to his own nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Paris, representing the dazed and
horrified condition of the whole war-stricken
country, indeed appeared mad
at that time. “<i>C’est la guerre!</i>” was
the explanation of every eccentric act;
every scarcity; every failure to carry on
business. All classes were in the streets,
gesticulating, arguing, or shouting wildly
to the hastily-mustered troops marching,
gay and confident, toward a hell of
horrors no one then could even picture.
“<i>C’est la guerre!</i>” came with dogged
bitterness from the lips of mothers, in
whose eyes still lingered the tears through
which they had smiled farewell to sons
they would never see again—from the
man behind the counter who absent-mindedly
regretted that he had not some
article asked for, until it was pointed out
to him, in his stock, by a persistent client.</p>

<p>To the French “<i>La Guerre</i>” meant the
pitiless monster of Bismarck’s time, whose
awful shadow still darkened the minds
which could remember Germany’s last
subtly-planned and opportune onslaught.
Although later on, as all the world knows,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
France faced the situation with admirable
courage and a wonderful spirit of
self-sacrifice and determination, at that
time her people appeared distraught by
a calamity too little provided against, and
too appallingly suggestive of disaster to
be contemplated with the calm and faith
quickly developed after the great Marne
victory.</p>

<p>That first awful period of consternation
eloquently revealed how little France had
premeditated conflict with her neighbour,
and makes the ever-glorious and miraculous
resistance of her and England’s armies,
against Germany’s superior forces and
perfected equipment, stand out as the
one astounding marvel of the war.</p>

<p>When my companion and I were startled,
while on a holiday expedition in the French
Alps, by the tocsin’s ominous tolling, we
were as dazed as were all others in the
quiet Alpine hamlet so abruptly shaken
from its world-ignoring calm.</p>

<p>To us, descending from the eternal
peace of snow-clad peaks, knowing nothing
of the menace that so rapidly rushed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
mightiest of nations into conflict such
as the world has never before known,
the scene of despair awakened by that
summons was inexpressibly affecting. We
had left the village in all the joy and
prosperity of its gladdest season, and
returned to find its streets thronged with
weeping and frenzied women, neglected
children, and pale-faced men, too stunned
for speech.</p>

<p>It was as though some inexplicable
cataclysm had struck the place, turning
a sane community mad; for at first the
significance of that slowly tolling bell
was not clear to us. The appalling truth,
however, became quickly known, and we,
with other aliens, were obliged, if not
provided with a <i>permis de séjour</i>, to leave
the locality within twelve hours and fly
from France.</p>

<p>The journey to Paris of twenty-eight
hours, side-tracked and shut up as we
were in a suffocatingly overcrowded
carriage, without food or water, was an
experience not likely to be forgotten by
anyone who suffered it. It served as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
preface to war; a preface which, save
for the lack of bloodshed, contained all
the moral miseries of battle—struggle,
menace, suffering, and even the proximity
of death, for several children and women
nearly perished of thirst and suffocation.</p>

<p>As the Paris banks were also closed to
foreign credit, we arrived there to find
no means of increasing our funds in hand—only
sufficient to cover the journey
back to Brussels (our place of residence),
whither, after a much-needed night of
repose, we expected to continue our
journey the following morning. But “<i>La
Guerre</i>” willed otherwise! All trains
being monopolized for the transfer of
troops, we, with several American
millionaires and other foreigners, were
forced to exist on trust, for a period that
appeared indefinite, within the palatial
walls of the Grand Hotel.</p>

<p>Looking down from the safe enclosure
of windows upon the dark tides of passion
and sorrow surging in the streets, it was
comical, as well as perplexing, to hear the
discourse of these pampered darlings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Fortune who, as yet, had no vaguest
idea of war’s true meaning, and seemed
to look upon the surrounding agitation
as little more than a characteristic of excitable
France. There was no definite
anxiety shown as to the possible consequences
of the outbreak. Its world-encircling
terrors could only be foreseen
by those who understood the length and
breadth of Germany’s ambitions. To the
Americans present it meant only a brief
European conflict, to which they and their
country were in no way related and from
which they were anxious to fly with all
possible speed. Some remarks there
uttered in facetious ignorance of the
moment’s real gravity recur to me now
in strange contrast to the heartfelt intensity
of America’s later sympathy, and
her slowly accumulating resentment toward
the Powers that made war more a
shame to humanity than ever before in
history.</p>

<p>“If this imprisonment goes on much
longer, I really don’t know what I shall
do!” exclaimed the wife of a wealthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
New York banker one day as we sat in
the sumptuous hotel drawing-room listening
to the outer roar; “I have only three
francs and twenty centimes between me
and death!”</p>

<p>This tragic announcement, from a
woman noted for her opulence, was spoken
with a mock gravity that called forth
general laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> have just seventy-five centimes!”
retorted another equally wealthy
dame. “If you will advance me one-fifty,
I shall give you a hundred per cent
interest when we reach the land of
liberty!”</p>

<p>“If we ever <i>do</i> reach it!” was the
joking reply. “No, dear lady, it is
far too dubious! I imagine we are
here to stay until the Germans are
beaten!”</p>

<p>“Good gracious! don’t suggest such a
thing!” exclaimed another. “That would
be <i>too</i> appalling!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it will not be so long! If England
comes in, we shall see the end of war
in a few weeks!”</p>

<p>“England! Don’t lay your hopes
there—England will never come in!”</p>

<p>“She certainly will,” ejaculated the
first speaker. “My husband says if
Belgium is violated, England will certainly
have a hand in the wicked business.”</p>

<p>“Germany is not likely to be so rash
as to violate Belgium’s neutrality,” remarked
a man present; “but if she does,
God help France!”</p>

<p>“<i>And</i> England!” muttered another.</p>

<p>“Well, all I know,” asserted one of the
women, “is that Mr. F.—and being a
diplomat, he ought to know!—told me
this morning it would be folly for England
to become embroiled. She isn’t prepared,
and she has no army.”</p>

<p>“She has a navy!”</p>

<p>“What use would a navy be against
an inland country?” scornfully retorted
one of the women; then, as though weary
of the folly of her sex, turned to a man
who had not yet spoken and asked:
“What do <i>you</i> think?”</p>

<p>He shrugged and replied rather disconsolately:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
“My dear lady, the whole affair
is too far beyond my comprehension for me
to form any opinion about it. Civilization
has been dealt a blow that leaves feeble
intellects, like mine, too dazed to think!”</p>

<p>“But do you think England will come
in?” persisted his questioner.</p>

<p>“She may and she may not,” was the
unsatisfactory reply. “I fail to see what
she can accomplish, in her present condition,
if she does.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she could be of great use!”
exclaimed the banker’s wife. “She could
patrol us across the briny deep, and that
is all I care about at present! Dear me!
if only our cars had not been requisitioned,
we might all have been on the sea by now!
I do think it rather an imposition to take
what belongs to neutrals!”</p>

<p>“They probably never asked to whom
the cars belonged,” returned the man.
“At a time like this, when every moment
lost counts against them, every vehicle
for transporting troops is too urgently
needed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose so!” the woman sighed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
“but I just wish I had not left mine
in Paris. They might have had it and
welcome, if they had allowed me to get
out first!”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand why <i>one</i> train for
foreigners can’t be run through to Calais,”
complained another. “There is no <i>system</i>—that
is the trouble!”</p>

<p>“System!” echoed the man. “How
can there be system, in regard to strangers,
when the country is shaken as by an
earthquake? The most powerful military
strength in the world, enhanced by all
the devices and war-machinery perfected
by half a century of study and preparation,
is rushing to overwhelm her unsuspecting
and unready forces! What is
your discomfort, or mine, or that of any
individual, when compared to the almost
inevitable ruin threatening France? We
can only wait and be patient. Our trials
are as nothing in comparison to what
every native of this country is now
suffering.”</p>

<p>This silenced complaints, and the very
typical conversation took a more serious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
tone. Not one of us really understood
the full gravity of the catastrophe. It
was too sudden and inexplicable. The
sentiments prevailing in Paris, at that
time, were scarcely wiser than ours; save
that former experience—the trials of a
war still remembered by many—added the
anguish of apprehension to incredulous
amazement. We, meanwhile, were more
annoyed than frightened, and looked on
the whole matter with egoistic intolerance,
angry that our plans should be disturbed
by so stupid an affair as international
discord!</p>

<p>But as days passed, bringing the astounding
information that Belgium was
likely to be invaded,—bringing also England’s
protest, followed by her entrance
into the fray,—even we neutrals began to
feel the far-reaching shadow of evil.</p>

<p>There appeared no vaguest chance of
getting away from distraught Paris; and,
hope of this being gradually eclipsed by
sympathy for the harassed people, a
number of us offered our services to one
of the many Red Cross associations rapidly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
forming in all quarters of the city. Not
knowing what better to do, we entered
a long, unventilated hall, crowded with
fashionably-attired women, mostly—in
this particular organization—stranded
Americans eager to be of use, rather than
pine in idleness for the comforts of unattainable
homes. A hard-faced, very
self-important Frenchwoman from one of
the hospitals addressed us, and for two
hours we perspired in the hall’s breathless
atmosphere, while our nerves were racked
by her piercing voice uttering a volley of
technical terms which not one in ten of
her auditors understood. We inscribed
our names as would-be helpers, and,
anticipating an early departure for the
front, provided ourselves with literature
likely to prepare us more quickly than
the Frenchwoman’s rapid flow of unintelligible
speech.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, living on charity was beginning
to fret those among us whose
financial standing was less widely known
than that of others with millions behind
them. The entering of the hotel’s vast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
dining-room to partake of meals we could
not pay for became embarrassing. One
evening, to avoid this, my companion
and I decided to procure edibles and have
a Bohemian meal in our own rooms. With
this in view, we set forth in search of such
refreshments as we could afford. But
the soldiers and their friends had been
before us; and, as commercial traffic
was at a standstill, new stock was not
procurable to replace what they had
exhausted.</p>

<p>If the city had been for months under
siege it could scarcely have been more
difficult to obtain food. Every <i>pâtisserie</i>
had been sold out; even the <i>délicatessen</i>
shops were void and the proprietors
offensively curt in reply to our amazed
inquiries.</p>

<p>“Why?” cried one, glaring personal
hatred upon us. “We are in war! <i>Voilà
pourquoi!</i> What do you expect? Next
week we shall be starving, with <i>les Allemands</i>
at our door!”</p>

<p>At another shop we secured two slices
of cold ham, a bottle of olives, yielded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
grudgingly, and, at still another, some
cream-cheese. Butter was invisible, and
our search for bread in vain, until, after
walking miles, we obtained two stale
rolls, all that remained of yesterday’s
stock, with the usual remark: “<i>C’est la
guerre!</i> What would you?”</p>

<p>Looking back, this seems incredible at
so early a date; but so it was, and demonstrated
to what a state of panic the people
were brought. They appeared to suspect
a German in everyone whose accent was
foreign, and my own probably was accountable
for the ungracious treatment
we received.</p>

<p>The following morning, much to the
general delight and surprise, glad tidings
reached us from the U.S. Embassy—a
train was to leave next day for Brussels!
Although forbidden to take other luggage
than a hand-satchel, we willingly left our
large pieces at the hotel, and took our
departure—quite forgetting that our names
were inscribed as first-aid to the wounded!
However, as ignorant paupers would
hardly have been of much use, we and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
other destitute foreigners who fled at
the first chance, were doubtless rather a
good riddance than a loss.</p>

<p>The journey proved almost normally
rapid and comfortable; and, once in
Belgium, where financial difficulties would
be remedied, we hoped to give what little
help we could to those so bravely preparing
to check the menaced invasion.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">BRUSSELS appeared, at first sight,
little affected by the tragedy
already in action at her outer gates.
Banks were doing business as usual; the
streets calm; the shops and cafés crowded
with apparently indifferent throngs, enjoying
life with as much appearance
of security as a year earlier. Although
it was the dead season, some smart
equipages were to be seen—a pleasant
sight after the dearth of horses and
vehicles in Paris! Taxi-cabs were still to
be had, and only the fact that we were
stopped four times by Belgian gendarmes—while
driving to the hotel where, owing
to lack of servants, we were obliged to
remain a few days—suggested the city’s
knowledge that war was raging without.</p>

<p>But during that short drive other signs
of change became visible. Innumerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
red crosses blazed from the whitened
windows of all public buildings and on
the house-roofs; while, here and there, a
demolished shop bearing a German name
gave evidence of former excitement now
stilled by a spirit of fearless confidence.
Sometimes, also, a troubled face in the
crowds told of thoughts centred on some
brave hero at Liège; or a motor-car, going
at reckless speed, suggested that the more
responsible were actively engaged preparing
to meet an overwhelming avalanche,
of whose magnitude no one in Belgium
then had any adequate conception. However,
there was, on the whole, so little
evidence of change in the city that it
was difficult to believe a hurriedly mustered
army was even then straining in deadly
conflict almost within cannon-hearing of
those bright streets. Several of the larger
business houses, however, were closed, or
converted into hospitals for the wounded.
Such was the “Financière” building, which
had been beautifully fitted up with every
modern convenience, and provided with
good surgeons, nurses, and everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
necessary for competent and comfortable
treatment.</p>

<p>We all immediately took part in these
preparations, each one eager to do his
share, however little, in readiness for the
first sad harvest of battle. No one then
realized how few of Belgium’s brave sons
would reap the benefit of these fond efforts;
but it was not long ere appalling circumstances
made this clear to the disappointed
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Hour by hour shocking news reached us
from the scene of struggle, such as the fall
of one fort after another at Liège, followed
by the enemies’ onward rush; while tales
of their pitiless cruelty caused brief waves
of apprehension to pass over the city—waves
quickly calmed, however, by indomitable
and astounding faith.</p>

<p>That the French and British would
come in time was the prevailing argument;
there was no danger nor cause for discouragement.
Even though the forts had
fallen, Belgium could hold the invaders
in check until adequate assistance arrived;
her forces might be driven back, step by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
step, for a short distance, but soon would
have the upper hand and drive the foe
back into Germany! Such was the
reasoning of a public blinded by their
heroic impulse to the situation’s real
peril. No sign of discouragement could
be detected even when the remorseless
grey tide was sweeping through ruined
and blood-soaked districts toward the
heart of their land.</p>

<p>And it was not merely the uneducated
who received the ill-tidings with this
amazing confidence, but men of high
standing and competent judgment.
Never, at that time, did I hear a word
indicative of fear; the enthusiastic faith
of the first days still remained unshaken.</p>

<p>Although the Government had already
withdrawn from Brussels, no one believed
that the capital was in danger; at any
rate, no word was uttered in my hearing
that betrayed the least anxiety on that
score.</p>

<p>“Have no fear,” the hotel proprietor
remarked, as I passed through the lobby
after breakfast on that fateful 20th of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
August 1914; “there is no danger of <i>les
Boches</i> getting to Brussels. Our men are
falling back only to gather force and
attain better positions. Besides, the
French and British are now at hand;
we need only hold out a day or two longer,
and then—<i>nous verrons</i>!” On every side
the same confidence greeted me: “<i>Les
Boches</i> are checked!... <i>Ils sont fichus!</i>...
The British are in Antwerp!...
In two weeks we shall be in Berlin!”
and so forth; all spoken with a sort of
delirious recklessness, suggesting determination
not to recognize disquieting
facts.</p>

<p>An hour or so after I left the hotel that
morning, my way was blocked by a silent
wall of people, lined on either side of the
Boulevard d’Anvers, watching, in stupefied
wonder, a seemingly interminable tide of
grey-clad warriors—the Prussian Fourth
Corps, under command of General von
Armin—proudly taking possession of their
fair city!</p>

<p>If that haughty and arrogant horde had
dropped into our midst from a cloudless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
sky, I hardly think it could have caused
more awed astonishment to the general
public. So fantastically harrowing had
been the tales of their uncivilized deeds
in other quarters of Belgium, that the
half-stunned people had come to think
of the German army as something fabulous,
something they were not likely ever to
behold as a material reality. Stories of
outrages, inconceivable in the present age,
had been so mingled with encouraging
reports of the monster’s repulse, that
popular opinion was unable to decide what
was true and what was not—was unable
to picture the awful menace rushing upon
them as other than a moral nightmare,
which, they imagined, would disappear
as abruptly and abnormally as it had
come.</p>

<p>The dazed amazement in the faces of that
watching throng might have moved a devil
to tears, or awakened rage in the heart
of an angel—so silent and helpless they
appeared before the mighty and pitiless
force advancing through the stunned city—so
callously indifferent was that force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to the shame of their deed! It was like
seeing a child confounded by the blow of a
strong man who strode by, smiling with
triumph at sight of its helpless pain. It
made one ashamed to be akin in species
to a race capable of committing, and
so arrogantly, a wrong never to be effaced
from their history.</p>

<p>Unknown to us at the time, Monsieur
Adolphe Max, the ever-to-be-honoured
Bourgmestre of Brussels, had gone early
that morning under a white flag to implore
the officer in command for permission to
telegraph a plea to the German Emperor
that his army be forbidden to enter
Brussels—the city where he, the Kaiser,
had been welcomed and entertained, only
a week or so earlier, by the Belgian King
and people. The officer promised to communicate
his request to the general-in-chief.
But the only reply Monsieur
Max received was, not only the entrance
of the troops, but a demand for enormous
quantities of food and a <i>contribution
de guerre</i> from the city of Brussels of
fifty million francs, to be paid in three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
days; and from the province of Brabant
four hundred and fifty millions, to be paid
before the 1st of September! This was
William the Second’s response to a people
whose faith he had betrayed, who had done
him no other ill than refusing to aid his
frantic impatience to overwhelm and crush
a neighbour and friendly state.</p>

<p>The following quantities of food-stuffs
were at once demanded from Brussels
by the German army and delivered:</p>

<p>On 21st August, 30,000 kilos of bread,
5000 kilos of smoked meat, 17,000
kilos live-stock, 10,000 kilos of rice,
1400 kilos of coffee, 1700 kilos of sugar,
700 kilos of cacao, 1700 kilos of salt,
120,000 kilos of oats, 170 kilos of tea,
10,000 litres of wine.</p>

<p>On 22nd August, the same amount,
save that the bread was reduced to
20,000 kilos, with an addition of 20,000
kilos of flour.</p>

<p>On 23rd August, everything in like
quantities was again yielded at the army’s
command, with the exception of bread,
which 30,000 kilos of flour replaced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>As this severe drainage threatened to
reduce to famine the 800,000 inhabitants
of Brussels, Monsieur Max informed the
German authorities he could not vouch
for the people’s submission if such exactions
continued. The occupying Government
thereupon agreed, over the Governor’s
signature, to make no more requisitions
during a period of eight days. But
the following day new demands were
presented, and an attempt, resisted by
Monsieur Max, was made to set aside a
contract which the army chiefs declined
to recognize as controlling their actions.</p>

<p>In regard to the war indemnity, Monsieur
Max arranged with the Government to
pay it off by instalments by the 30th of
September. Payments were made regularly,
and of the 50,000,000 there remained
due but 4,400,000 to be paid when, on
the 24th of September, von Luettwitz announced
that no further reimbursement
would be made by the army for food-stuffs
requisitioned, as the war indemnity
had not been paid within the time originally
specified!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>But my object is not to go into these
details, or to depict, more than is
necessary, the darker side of Belgium’s
martyrdom under German dominion. The
world knows enough of such matters and
will probably know more before these recollections
appear. Tragedy and sorrow,
moreover, have been heard, seen, felt <i>ad
nauseam</i> by every dweller in the occupied
country. No account of those years
can escape their dominating note of
tragedy, but all such events herein given
are limited to those not generally known,
whose truth has been personally ascertained.</p>

<p>The invasion of a capital by enemy
troops had always seemed to me the
culminating tragedy of war, and one likely
to be rife with stirring incidents. How
little like my preconceived idea was this
silent and awesome mastery—this slowly-moving
stream of concentrated force,
passing between those walls of ashen-white
faces, whence thousands of wide
eyes spoke the voiceless misery and amazement
of a people betrayed! The warrior’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
pride was not lacking, but a pride less
admirable even than that of the criminal
forces led by Napoleon into capitals which
he had overwhelmed.</p>

<p>But why connect with this ignoble victory
the supremely evil Corsican’s name?
Napoleon, like Alexander and Hannibal,
was superb almost to the end. But
William II., devoid of magnetism, devoid
of the human understanding and tact so
essential to a great leader, sought to follow
in his steps with no finer attribute than
long-nourished brute force and meanly-developed
craftiness. He utterly failed
to recognize that no number of cannon, no
number, however stupendous, of enslaved
legions, could replace Napoleon’s understanding.</p>

<p>From Germany’s regiments of triumphant
treachery, advancing through Brussels,
no glance of comprehension or compassion
met the people’s wide-eyed gaze. Only
one sentiment could be read in the eyes
looking sternly upon them from under
shining Prussian helmets—a vainglorious
contempt for the race that had so sublimely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
resisted their unjust and inexorable
demands.</p>

<p>The scene, viewed from the standpoint
of one bred in a country long since
rid of barbarism, appeared strangely anachronistic
and theatrical—like the blazing
pageantry of a stage, briefly holding
the attention of an enlightened community
which would presently ring down
the curtain and return to real and serious
occupations. The leaders—young men,
for the most part, of noble families; men
whose brain and morals had been cramped,
since infancy, into the narrow circumference
of their eagle-topped helmets—sat
their horses in the heroic pose of a
stage Siegfried. Their polished armour
and ornaments reflected heaven’s sun as
meretriciously as do those of Wagner’s
characters the glare of the footlights.
Each one appeared inwardly inflated by a
sense of individual world-power, by an
intoxicating impression that in him was
revived the spirit of conquering Rome—and,
with it, the right to tread under his
spurred foot the wan faces his absurdly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
proud glance surveyed. Then came the
worn troops following on foot—they who
had borne the brunt of conflict—devoid
of ornament, trudging along at the horses’
heels, obedient offenders of the people
who despised them; hoodwinked slaves,
persuaded they were serving their country,
while inflicting and enduring the tortures
of hell merely to enhance imperial
pride and save the despotic throne so long

<p class="drop-cap noindent">AFTER that tragic day, Brussels
came more and more under the
tyranny of the “iron fist” by which the
Kaiser once boasted he would win the
world-power unattained by other and far
more capable enemies of peace. German
soldiers swarmed through the streets,
always hurrying to fulfil urgent business
of their impatient leaders, who, on their
way to overwhelm France, panted to
thrust the sword of ruin deeper into
hapless Belgium. During those first
weeks of the occupation the city appeared
obsessed by a restless mass of grey-robed
energy. Every unit of the vast armies
seemed infected by this passion. The
streets fairly roared with frenzy-driven
automobiles, enormous war-like things,
sombre as mighty death-machines, mostly
torpedo-shaped, driven, with entire disregard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
for the safety of pedestrians,
through streets ridded of all traffic that
might hamper their way. The harsh or
piercing cries of their horns never ceased;
nor, when an officer of high rank was the
occupant, the gay bugle notes, clear and
triumphantly joyous, which so racked
the aching nerves and hearts of every
native. I think no one then in Brussels,
who took the invasion to heart, will ever
forget that bright, repeated melody so
galling to those whose dear ones had
perished in the unequal struggle.</p>

<p>The <i>voyous</i> of the rue Haute districts,
however, found a means of shaming it to
silence, after the great repulse at the Marne.
They put words to the melody and sang
them at full voice in echo, each time the
bugle announced the presence of a high
official. The words, which fitted perfectly,
were: “<i>C’est loin à Paris!</i>”</p>

<p>Presently, it was heard no more, and only
then, it seemed, did the stunned Belgians
begin to awake and take some interest
in life. They could do little for their
wounded; for all hospitals, as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
public buildings, were seized by the enemy
to house Germany’s mutilated slaves, or
serve as resting-places for troops. All the
comfort many of these latter enjoyed was
a litter of straw laid on the floors of
corridors.</p>

<p>I was obliged to step over their sleeping
and evidently exhausted forms when,
seeking a pass one day to go to our villa,
ten miles from Brussels, I was erroneously
led by a dull-witted soldier, who should
not have admitted me, to the top floor of
the post-office building. There I saw his
commanding officer—who (it turned out)
had nothing whatever to do with the giving
of passes! Though it was after midday,
the men lay sleeping like animals all along
the hallways, and their chief, roused from
repose on a sofa in a separate room, was
angrily struggling into his great boots
when I was announced. His rage at
being disturbed, but more at having me
appear before he was ready to receive
me with impressive dignity, was vented
in a volley of abusive language hurled at
the wretched subordinate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The situation was indeed rather embarrassing
for a leader—though a minor
one—of the power-proud Prussian army.
With feet clad only in grey woollen socks,
hair roughened, and eyes red and heavy
with sleep, he certainly presented a rather
comical picture, crimson with anger and
bellowing insults at the man, whom he
ordered from the room. Of me he took
not the slightest notice until the boots
were on, and during that interval of
silence, shut up as I was alone with him in
a place where, as I saw at once, I had no
proper excuse for intruding, my one desire
was to find some means of escape before
he should notice me; for I expected
anything but polite treatment at his
hands.</p>

<p>However, apart from a certain amount
of silly boasting, and a rather superior
expression of regret that he could not
provide the desired pass, he said nothing
really objectionable in answer to my
surprising appeal, although his expression
showed he had no very flattering
idea of my intelligence. On learning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
my nationality, and how wrong direction
had led me to him, the arrogance of his
manner softened considerably: “You will
not be able to go to your villa at present,”
he said on learning where it was, “our
armies are now in that locality; and
even if you were permitted to go, it
would not be safe.”</p>

<p>“But the house may be destroyed,” I
replied, “and there are things I value
there which no money could replace.”</p>

<p>He shrugged and returned, with mock
sympathy quickly followed by vanity,
“<i>Schade!</i>—but no exceptions can be made.
Others have lost their treasures, and many
more are likely to. War does not consider
individuals.”</p>

<p>“But why <i>is</i> there war in this country?”
I ventured. “What on earth is your excuse
for coming here to ruin a peaceful nation?”</p>

<p>“Belgium was given her chance to
avoid war—she would not take it; that
is not our fault!”</p>

<p>I longed to tell him a few unflattering
truths, but the fact of being four stories
above the street, with hundreds of armed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
men within call, forced me to limit my
reply to: “That depends how one understands
fault; certainly the Belgians were
not at fault.”</p>

<p>“They were; they were siding with
England and France. Stupid people!
What will they gain by making an enemy
of Germany? The Allies must yield to
us; then where will Belgium be?”</p>

<p>“And if they do not yield?”</p>

<p>He laughed softly: “<i>Ach!</i> There is
no question of that! Are we not rushing
on France already? In three weeks or
less we shall be in Paris, and shortly after
that we shall have England at our mercy.”</p>

<p>I forced a smile, though inwardly his
confidence made me tremble. “Aren’t
you counting a little too much on your
successful invasion of a very small and
unprepared country? England and France
may also be unprepared, but they have
greater resources and more time to collect
them than poor Belgium had.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ach, bewahr!</i>” he replied scornfully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
“they can never resist our armies. When
we take Paris, England’s morale will be
broken; she will not be able to raise an
army!”</p>

<p>“If you take it!”</p>

<p>“No, <i>when</i> we take it!” he replied, with
quite a genial smile. “Don’t deceive
yourself; we Germans do not attempt
things we are not sure of attaining.
Everything is planned to the smallest
detail. But tell me, are you in sympathy
with the Allies?”</p>

<p>“I am a neutral.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ach, so!</i>... Are all Americans
strictly neutral?”</p>

<p>“They are supposed to be.”</p>

<p>He eyed me thoughtfully before saying:
“I think they are jealous of us, like England—like
all the world! This war must
prove Germany’s supremacy and put an
end to all that!”</p>

<p>As this interview took place some little
time before the battle of the Marne, I
must own to a very unneutral pang of
resentment, mingled with dread lest his
boasting might prove well founded. But,
galling as it was, I was convinced the man
spoke only what had been drilled into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
him, and not his own sentiments. He
was quite a young fellow, neither aristocratic
in appearance nor so self-important
as are most of his class. His round blue
eyes often softened with the wistful musing
of a mind not altogether sure of what
he boasted, nor why he was there—what
was leading men only slightly more enslaved
than he, to fight for an object none
could define. Later on he recited some
of the horrors he had witnessed on his
way from Liège—the so-called legitimate
horrors of war, not those relating to
civilians—and spoke almost with tears of
certain friends he had lost in the conflict.
Thus softened, he invited me to have
coffee with him in his den, and pressingly
repeated the invitation all the way down
those interminable, man-encumbered flights
of stairs which I made for as soon as
politeness permitted. My entering of the
room of an officer in command, to obtain
a pass which only the administrative
authorities could give, might very easily
have been understood as an attempt to
spy, or attributed to some other equally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
dangerous motive. Consequently, I could
only be grateful, when again at liberty,
that my blundering guide had not led me
into the presence of a success-drunken
superior officer, who might have exhibited
his native bullying tendencies when he
found me at his mercy. My chance host,
it must be acknowledged, was not of this
type, and only in regard to Belgium did
he reveal that tyranny toward weakness
so characteristic of most Prussians in
authority.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">THE lower-class Belgian’s horror of
the invaders grew daily, as more
and more harrowing tales of their atrocities
came to us from regions through which
their armies were rushing. “<i>Schrechlichkeit</i>”
was attaining its object at a bitter
price to the poor unreasoning peasants,
who saw not only those dear to them
slain for no apparent cause, but also their
superiors, priests, prominent townsmen,
and even women and children. Stories
reached us of such unparalleled ugliness
that many refused to credit them, and
only when like crimes were committed
in and about Brussels could we believe
modern humanity capable of such deeds.
These are now more or less known to the
outer world; although doubtless many
done in secret will never come to light,
save when the victims, at the Last Judgment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
add their voice of condemnation
to those of innocent men, women, and
children sent to sudden and ghastly death
on the <i>Lusitania</i>. But that revolting
crime had not yet happened, to inflame
neutral minds in Brussels, which, until
convinced of those done in Belgium, were
genuinely neutral.</p>

<p>So unbiased, indeed, was the feeling
among them that even the violation of
Belgium was looked on by some as an
ugly action, but not wholly damning
according to war morals. I heard neutral
men, who admired Germany, even seek to
excuse it as a daring and possibly necessary
“strategic move.” But less than three
weeks after the fall of Liège, these very
men were among the bitterest and most
outspoken haters of the race they had
tried to defend. Civilized sentiment was
so outraged by the wrongs heaped upon
Belgians that several Americans, Dutch,
and other neutrals undertook, for their
own satisfaction, to investigate certain
awful incidents related. When they were
convinced that these were not only true,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
but in some cases too mildly depicted,
their neutrality fled in a storm of rage.</p>

<p>The terror which these acts temporarily
roused in the peasantry was revealed to
me the day I ventured out, by bicycle, to
our villa in the vicinity of Wavre. No
other means of conveyance being available,
I discovered, after considerable
search, an old wheel unearthed from the
depths of a merchant’s cellar—one of the
few secreted to escape requisition. No
trains were running and no trams, and
offer of high payment failed to tempt the
drivers of such few miserable hack-horses
as remained after the taxi-cabs had been
seized. But, by starting early in the
morning, it was possible to make the trip
by wheel, pack, and return before nightfall.
So, having obtained a German pass
from Government headquarters the day
after my visit to the sleepy officer at the
post office, I attached a small American
flag to the handle-bar, and started forth
at six a.m. through the deserted Bois,
and thence to still more deserted country
roads. There was no traffic in those days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
save occasional German military cars, and
no sign of human or any other life on the
roads. The Belgians were then for the
most part keeping indoors, in some cases
through fear of the Germans, in others
because, commerce and business being
dead, they had nothing to tempt them
out; therefore, until I reached an outlying
village, I met no one to direct me. Here,
while coasting down the main road,
flanked by modest peasant abodes, I was
startled by seeing two men rush out, and
wave frantically to stop me.</p>

<p>“You can’t proceed!” exclaimed one
as I dismounted. “Come quickly into the
house! <i>Vite! Vite!</i> They are there,
just beyond!”</p>

<p>“Who?” I asked, amazement at this
hysterical excitement making me forget
the cause of their terror.</p>

<p>“<i>Les Allemands!</i> Come—be quick;
they will appear at any moment!”</p>

<p>If a tribe of hungry cannibals had been
in the vicinity, their agitation could not
have been greater. Women were shrieking
warnings from windows, children peering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
terrified from behind curtains, and the
two men literally trying to drag me indoors.</p>

<p>“But I <i>must</i> go on!” I exclaimed. “I
have a pass and am an American!”</p>

<p>“<i>C’est égal!</i> they respect nothing!”
was the reply. “They will shoot you
down! They will rob and tear you
to bits! <i>Ne savez-vous pas ce que c’est
qu’un Boche?</i> He is a beast without
reason! He stops at nothing! Think
only what our innocents have suffered!”</p>

<p>“And my old father, who did no
wrong!” wailed a woman from the
window.</p>

<p>“They are burning the village beyond!”
cried another.</p>

<p>Then several at once: “They killed
my brother.... They cut off the hands
of little children; ... they burned the
farm of So-and-so and murdered his
daughter!... <i>Et mon fils! mon fils!</i>
the father of a family! he lies, buried with
twenty others in a heap, at Tamines!”</p>

<p>All that was said I could not hear, indeed
did not try to, and being anxious to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
go on, sought to escape the two men’s
kindly attention. When they were at
last persuaded to resign me to the predicted
doom, I sped on down the hill to a
cross-road, and, turning to the right, saw a
moving mass of troops rapidly approaching
in the direction I was obliged to take—on
foot, as the road mounted too steeply
to permit of riding. The troop gained
on me so rapidly that their heavy tramp
and rough breathing were soon audible.
Before we reached the level they were
striding along within arm’s reach, line
after line of dusty, perspiring, war-brutalized
men, pressing on to new scenes of
slaughter. The mounted officers in command
glanced at me, noted the flag which
then had not been forbidden, and returned
their eager gaze to the distance beyond,
evidently controlled but by one idea.
<i>Haste</i>—that was the motto of these frenzy-driven
legions, ordered to rush into France
despite all obstacles, over the living and
the dead, treading even, if need be, their
own fellows under foot!</p>

<p>The soldiers were the heavy, stalwart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
men of the first German army, trained and
hardened for war—conscious machines of
destruction, who appeared to have forgotten
they were human. In their faces
one saw only an animal-like, unquestioning
obedience that had become,
through long domination, the very essence
of their strength, the will actuating their
movements, their thought, their very life;
“Not to reason why; but to do and die,”
seemed branded on their souls. In none of
the many different army contingents that
later came to Brussels, either allied or German,
was this strange, dogged, unhuman
and unthinking obedience so strikingly
visible. While watching them and noting
their expression of unintelligent, inexorable
determination to push on according to
supreme command, the impression came to
me that, had I fallen and lain disabled
in the road, they would have marched
over me as unhesitatingly as they trod
the dust.</p>

<p>At the hotel where we were staying,
a party of English nurses were putting
in a weary time waiting vainly for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
wounded. One of these had offered to
accompany me on the trip to our villa,
but at the last moment was forbidden to
do so by her superior. The evening of my
return from the expedition, which proved
successful and less eventful than predicted,
I told them that it had been accomplished
without the difficulties expected
by their matron. “Really? So glad!”
replied the one referred to, evidently
regretting that she had been denied this
chance to relieve her dull days.</p>

<p>They were a rather disconsolate lot,
very smart-looking, in their pretty nursing
uniforms, but bored by enforced idleness.
More than one told me, with true
British spirit, that she would prefer to be
in the most dangerous section of the front
rather than pass another idle day at the
expense of those they had come to serve.
Later on this wish was gratified, and no
doubt each of them has more than repaid
the cost of their brief period of sloth.</p>

<p>A certain man, also residing at the
hotel, was constantly haunting these
women, who complained of his persistent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
attentions and efforts to draw them into
conversation. He posed as an Englishman,
and, before England entered the
war, had been in that country. But his
appearance was not English, and his voice
had a guttural accent that made me
suspect him of being a German spy—a
suspicion that I later had reason to believe
was well founded. He had the room next
to mine, with a communicating door,
through which one could hear voices even
when lowered. Visitors constantly came
there, mostly women who spoke French
along the corridor to the servant directing
them, but, once in his room with the door
closed, spoke German, and usually took
care that no word should be heard outside.
But one day a woman entered so early
that the knock at his door awakened me;
I then heard low voices and the crisp rattle
of papers. Presently another woman was
shown into the room; and she, evidently
agitated, spoke in German loud enough
for me to hear in my bed these significant
sentences:
“<i>Ach Gott</i>, you are confident,
but I am not! It is said the Russians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
mean to make of it a religious war. In
that case it will go hard with Germany.”
The man’s reply was too low to be heard,
and she continued: “To be sure; but
look at this.” A sound came of paper
like that of a letter being opened. At this
moment the telephone-bell rang; the man
answered it in French, and his words
came to me clearly: “Hallo! Yes. She
is here with me now; I have seen the
letter.... <i>Pas du tout!</i> Do nothing
until I see you.... Yes, he is a Belgian,
but his <i>wife</i> is English—there are two
sons; one got away the day the Germans
entered.... Inquire at the Anglo-American
club, Toison d’Or.... <i>Oh zut!</i>—tell
him I shall be at your place at
eleven and——” The rest was drowned
by someone’s pet dog barking in the
corridor—a soldier’s dog, as it proved
afterwards.</p>

<p>On descending for dinner that evening,
my companion and I were joined, while
awaiting the lift, by two German soldiers—probably
the orderlies of officers lodged
on the same <i>étage</i>. With them was a fox
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
terrier, doubtless the one that interrupted
my eavesdropping. It approached to be
caressed, which led me to ask the soldiers
if they intended to take it to the front.</p>

<p>“<i>Gewiss!</i>” replied one, rather aggressively;
“he will come with us to
Paris and then to <i>London</i>!”</p>

<p>The emphasis on the last word betrayed
that he thought me English, and the
intended taunt angered me.</p>

<p>“Really?” I replied; “evidently you
think I am English!”</p>

<p>He smiled shamefacedly, and blurted
naïvely: “Aren’t you?”</p>

<p>I coldly told him my nationality, and
added: “But if I <i>were</i> English your
boast would not trouble me. You are
still a long way from Paris, and even if
you ever <i>should</i> get there, you would
not remain long. And as for London—you
might more easily get to heaven!”</p>

<p>They received this sally with confident
laughter, and left the lift, one repeating
significantly, emphasizing the words with
an upraised finger:
“You’ll see! You’ll see!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> </p>
<p>As the German military element was
increasing daily at the hotel, all persons
of other nationalities departed, save those
obliged to remain. We, the British nurses,
and some few Belgians, unable to return
to their homes in other parts of Belgium,
were consequently in constant association
with numerous high officials, who, in the
first pride of victory, discarded their war-raiment
for brilliant blue dress-uniforms,
ornamented with gold or silver. They
strutted about with a domineering air of
superiority which later became greatly
modified, but at that time was insufferable.</p>

<p>One evening, immediately after the fall
of Reims, when the Belgian spirit was
more depressed than ever before, a dinner
was held in the public dining-room by a
number of high-grade officers. They were
seated at a long table close to ours, all
in gala attire, and evidently jubilant
over some new disaster to the Belgian
forces—a satisfaction which they appeared
particularly anxious should be noted by
the Belgians present. But the latter, who
hid their aching hearts under lowered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
eyelids, appeared not to heed them.
Outside, however, there were many interested
watchers. As the evening was warm,
windows had been left open, and at them
gathered the idle street crowds, with
nothing, night or day, to divert their
thoughts—no business, no theatres, no
cafés—and too anxious to remain in their
homes.</p>

<p>No slight consideration for their helpless
and ruined victims, looking in on the
joyous party, stayed the gay laughter and
toasts of those at that table! Triumph,
which common decency should have impelled
them to indulge privately, was
flagrantly flourished in the wan faces of
men who knew not how they were to
feed their families in a week’s time, of
youths cast out of employment and unable
to give their country the aid they longed
to give.</p>

<p>Soldiers bearing dispatches constantly
entered the room, trod heavily, with
clatter of spurs, to within a few paces of
the table, drew up, brought their heels
together, and stood at salute until given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
permission to approach. Officers of lower
rank paused, on seeing the august and
radiant gathering, saluted, and continued
to bow and salute while passing the table
to find a smaller one in another part of
the room. Judging by their servility and
that of the soldiers, the two in general’s
attire at the dinner must have been of
high rank, but their identities were not
known in the hotel. To my eyes each
looked as important as the other, puffed
up with pride, betraying, in every glance
and movement, confident conviction that
the present satisfaction was but a fore-runner
of greater triumphs.</p>

<p>Again and again when a dispatch was
read, evidently containing satisfactory
news from the front, the joyous cry,
“<i>Hoch! Hoch! Hoch!</i>” rang out to
that pathetically wistful audience, who
knew it was in celebration of a fresh wound
dealt to the country they loved. And
yet in their pale, troubled faces no sign
of hatred or rage could be detected,
only the same childlike curiosity expressed
on the first day, and a sort of puzzled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
wonder, as though they found it difficult
to believe that atrocities such as were
committed in their land had been ordered
by men of such good appearance, and
apparently so civilized. Even to us it
seemed incredible, while watching that
gathering of smart-looking, intelligent
beings, who might have won the respect,
possibly even the admiration, of a people
accustomed throughout their history to
the wrongdoings of mightier nations;
who, as a whole, would have appreciated
a generous recognition of their noble and
courageous stand for honour. But those
men, whose close-cropped, sabre-scarred
heads were held so high above a uniform
they gradually made odious to the entire
world, were blinded by vanity, delirious
with success. The long-awaited hour of
opportunity had arrived, as pregnant with
great promise as those that bred the first
Roman and the first French empires; an
hour when Europe, lulled by the harmony
of peace, might be shocked to submission
before Germany’s secretly-created Frankenstein!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>It was amazing to see, during the first
week or so of the occupation, with what
naïve interest the Belgians clustered about
even minor units of the army that had
so ruthlessly afflicted them. They would
pause to stare at a common soldier with
something of the awed perplexity the
Indians of America evinced on their first
introduction to firearms; or gather, silent
and gaping, about the great automobiles to
watch imposing officers alight. This unconscious
flattery, evidently relished, disappeared,
however, in a short time, not
only because Prussians became so prevalent
that they no longer attracted attention,
but because the more intelligent citizens
took a stand against it, and reproved
those who thus gratified the vanity of
their enemies. And the people were not
slow to realize an error due more to their
lack of occupation than to tolerant interest
in the intruders. Disaster, in fact, had
come so suddenly upon them; their lives
had been so abruptly changed from the
even tenor of prosperity to want and
misery, that they were too stunned at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
once to realize the cause. Some among
the lower classes, indeed, appeared incapable
of seeing the situation as other
than a temporary, inexplicable calamity,
not likely to endure more than a week or
two. For this reason, no doubt, there
was very little resentment in speech or
action. The general attitude was one of
patient endurance of incomprehensible ills,
a fact which made the lying German excuses
for their atrocities ring false to all
who had witnessed the inoffensive bearing
of the inhabitants at the time of their
bitterest hour, when the enemy entered
Brussels.</p>

<p>Better-class Belgians, who understood
the situation, were bitter enough in
private speech, and in their determined
and unflinching efforts to hamper the
invaders by every possible means which
their unarmed and imprisoned condition
permitted. That they accomplished much
secretly, and despite the severe and ever-increasing
espionage, was acknowledged
by the Germans themselves, when information
of their every movement was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
proved to have reached the Allied forces
within an hour. Every effort was made
by the Government to solve the mystery,
and discover the secret means by which
the exact locality of a Zeppelin garage
or ammunition depot, army movements,
etc., was at once conveyed to their adversaries.
Many suffered death or long
imprisonment on mere suspicion of connection
with these secret societies, and
spies in civil dress were set to watch even
such as were not suspected, whose intelligence
or standing made it possible
they might be in the secret. Another
mystery especially galling to the Prussians
was the inexplicable publication and
distribution of the <i>Libre Belgique</i>, a
small truth-telling journal, which spared
neither the Kaiser nor his army in its
caustic and often insulting criticism, and
served as a tonic to the oppressed people;
an antidote to poison injected with
malignant persistency by the occupying
Powers. No amount of persecution, investigation,
or bribery led to the discovery
of where this brave little sheet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
was published, or who managed it; but
several entire families were arrested and
subjected to the torture of military
inquisition, to fines and long terms of
imprisonment, on very slight grounds of
suspicion.</p>

<p>Although the <i>Libre Belgique</i> seldom
contained any definite news from outside,
its free voice, speaking openly what everyone
longed to utter but dared not, was
a delight to us all. Persons of the very
highest social standing undertook its
circulation, carrying copies in hollowed-out
walking-sticks, lining of hats, and so
forth, in order to distribute them as widely
as possible. Some day the story of its
origin, its compositors, and indiscoverable
place of publication will be known and
welcomed with intense interest by all
who drew from its single page almost the
only ray of encouragement and hope those
dark years offered for jaded spirits.</p>

<p>On the evening of the military dinner
above referred to, which was in the early
part of September, an incident occurred
serving, in an impressive manner, to relieve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the fretting recollection of that callously
gay party, which had forced us
and, I think, many others to leave the
hotel immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>In the midst of that discordant levity,
when the Prussians’ laughter and noisy
toasts were ringing through the room,
there suddenly sounded from without a
wild and excited cry that swelled to a very
thunder of voices as it was taken up by
the throngs in the street. Naturally, we
all sprang from table and hurried to the
entrance door, anticipating we knew not
what, for the cries were too glad in tone
to suggest any fresh blast of all-too-familiar
calamity.</p>

<p>Outside many persons from near-by
houses had gathered in the middle of the
boulevard—men in shirt-sleeves, women
only partly dressed, children, and aged
grandparents, all electrified by a note of
joy such as they had not heard since they
had cheered their departing army only a
few weeks ago; weeks already seeming like
years! All were gazing upwards into the
pale sky of a summer-like twilight.
“<i>Le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
voilà! le voilà!</i>” was shouted on every
side in rough men’s voices, the shriller
tones of women, and the piping treble of
children. When the object of interest became
visible to all—an Allied aeroplane
soaring, like a bird of good omen, just above
the street—those disjointed cries blended
into one universal roar, that seemed to
shake to their foundations the lines of
massive buildings against which it rang.</p>

<p>So hysterically intense was the excitement
that it looked for some moments
as if the people had lost control of themselves,
and as if some perilous outbreak
would be the consequence—an event that
could only lead to ruthless slaughter of the
unarmed citizens. But the pathetic, almost
tragic, poetry of the scene made one oblivious
of everything threatening. One felt
only the doleful significance of that high-soaring,
unapproachable friend from the
outer world, at whose message of encouragement
we could only guess; whose coming
only made clearer the fact that all who
watched it from the dusk-shadowed streets
were prisoners, as much cut off from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
free world as though interned on some
island far removed from the sphere of
former interests, and denied all communication
with it.</p>

<p>I had not fully realized our woeful position
before the air-craft’s appearance,
which stirred me to echo the excitement
and joy of that helpless throng,
watching, many with tears in their eyes,
this proof that they were not forgotten by
the nations they had so bravely served.</p>

<p>Although it was nearly eight p.m., daylight
still lingered in the heavens, or rather
a soft, green aftermath of day where the
great bird circled, high above the house-tops,
dark and awe-inspiring in that sea
of pale light.</p>

<p>“<i>C’est un Anglais!</i>” cried some; and
others: “<i>C’est un Français!</i>” “<i>C’est un
Belge!</i>” while again and again a wild
shout of glad greeting rose from the streets
to that far visitor, which was presently
recognized as a Belgian.</p>

<p>Suddenly a still louder sound shocked
these cries to a brief silence. The echoing
report of cannon, already set up at advantageous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
points in the city, told that
the visitor had been espied by less loving
eyes. However, he seemed to know that
nothing could reach him at that particular
point. At any rate, he never wavered, and
while the cannon roared, and cries rose
again, now in frantic applause of his courage,
he hovered as before, quietly winging
in a circle above the darkening capital,
seeming, by easy and fearless movement,
to express sympathy and encouragement.</p>

<p>When light deepened and lamps began
to flare in the sombre streets, the air-craft,
whose driver evidently realized he would
soon be invisible, turned with a wide
sweep and, heading southward, flew off
into the violet mist of distance, dying into
a mere speck still passionately watched
by yearning eyes from that sea of upturned
faces.</p>

<p>Later on these aerial visits became frequent;
but this one, the first sign we had
had since the occupation from the outside
world, made a lasting impression. It was
said later that printed slips—a sample of
which I unfortunately never saw—had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
dropped from the aeroplane bearing this
cheering message: “Have courage for a
little time; we shall soon deliver you.”</p>

<p>That, alas, was in the first days of
autumn 1914!</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">CONDITIONS in Brussels became day
by day more like those of a vast
prison. The prospect of escape only grew
slighter with time, and the yoke of German
methods more and more bitter. Their
<i>affiches</i>, recounting the marvellous achievements
of “<i>nos troupes victorieuses</i>,” their
proclamations of all sorts with which the
walls were constantly papered, were like
hot irons turned in the wounds of the
Belgians, painful to everyone in sympathy
with the victims. Even announcements
derogatory to the Belgian army
were not spared them. In one German
report, which I read, a Belgian prisoner
was quoted as having praised the German
army to the detriment of his own, and
as having added: “If we were led by
German officers, we should do as well as
German soldiers.” Of course everyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
understood this as only another sample of
<i>la vérité allemande</i>, but nevertheless it
brought the blood of anger to the face of
many a man longing, but unable, to
strangle the armed liar with his shackled
hands.</p>

<p>There was an ungenerous spirit expressed
in every announcement of events
such as the Belgians were most eager to
hear—a spirit especially inexcusable in a
victorious power. Every success of the
Allied armies was either ridiculed or
ignored; only the Germans’ progress was
set forth in glowing words, and victories
of real importance were presented in exaggerated
detail, on bright blue bulletins
which no eye could avoid seeing. No
event, however trivial—as compared to
their own rapid advance—that might
awake even a brief thrill of enthusiasm or
hope in their prisoners, was allowed by
the Germans to reach them. Even the
Marne victory was so disguised that I
have since heard German officers, engaged
in administrative duty in Brussels, state
how neither they, nor any of their friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
in Germany, knew the reason of that
astounding reverse, never definitely acknowledged
by official reports.</p>

<p>On 2nd September 1914 the Governor,
von der Goltz, had published a proclamation
luring the Belgians to obedience by
pretended sympathy with their patriotic
feelings. This began as follows: “Belgian
citizens: I demand of no one to renounce
his patriotic sentiments. I expect of you
all a sensible submission and absolute
obedience in regard to the Governor-General’s
orders. I invite you to show him
confidence and lend him your assistance.”</p>

<p>Two weeks later von Luettwitz, the
Military Governor, demanded the withdrawal
of the Belgian flag—the sole expression
of patriotic sentiment possible to a
people whose speech, action, and will
were under subjection. This was the
first step in an administration of tyranny,
which rapidly developed to unprecedented
brutality under the odious governments
which followed.</p>

<p>The noble Mayor of Brussels, Bourgmestre
Max, fought Luettwitz and von
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
der Goltz with unrelenting obstinacy and
courage, in every instance where they
sought to ignore agreements which they
had solemnly made at the time of their
entrance—and quickly set aside when
safely installed! It was only then that
the flags were forbidden, which had been
allowed to float until the iron hand had
closed firmly on the city; only then that
demands were made contrary to primary
agreements. All manner of injustice was
resorted to under the plea that, “<i>nécessité
faisant loi</i>,” the former contracts no longer
held good.</p>

<p>On the 29th of August the Military
Governor of Liège had a bulletin posted in
that city announcing that Monsieur Max
had stated that the French Government
declared itself unable to assist Belgium
in any way. The following day Monsieur
Max proved the indomitable courage that
made him so hateful to the Germans, by
publishing, in wall-posters with enormous
headlines, a flat denial of this utterly
untruthful assertion. His <i>affiche</i> was as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<div class="bq">
  <p>“Aux Habitants de la Ville de Liège</p>

  <p>“Le Bourgmestre de Bruxelles a fait
    savoir au Commandant allemand que le
    Gouvernement français a déclaré au
    Gouvernement belge l’impossibilité de
    l’assister offensivement en aucune manière,
    vu qu’il se voit lui-même forcé à la défensive.”</p>

  <p>To this repetition of the German announcement
    M. Max added in the largest
    available type:</p>

  <p>“J’oppose à cette affirmation le démenti
    le plus formel.</p>

  <p class="ar">
    “<span class="smcap">Adolphe Max.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>It must have been a staggering surprise
to the invaders, who thought their frightfulness
had killed the Belgian spirit, and
consequently that their trick would
succeed.</p>

<p>Von Luettwitz at once publicly forbade
the posting of any bulletin without his
permission.</p>

<p>To be rid of a man who so energetically
defied them on undeniable grounds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
right, they arrested Adolphe Max alleging
that he had failed to deliver the whole
amount of war indemnity within the
specified time. Although Echevin Jacqmain
offered himself as hostage in place
of the Bourgmestre so greatly loved and
needed by the people of Brussels, his offer
was declined; and on the 26th of September
Monsieur Max was carried away in an
automobile—followed and preceded by
others filled with armed men!—to be
imprisoned in a fortress. With his departure,
Brussels was more than ever at
the mercy of those who ruled her with the
despotism and unnecessary severity which
newly-won power always develops in men
of shallow mind and ignoble character.</p>

<p>So it was not sufficient that the flags
had been withdrawn in response to the
beautiful appeal Monsieur Max had made
to the people—an appeal which, after
referring to the inconsistency of the
German order with former agreements,
ended in these words:
“Je demande à
cette population de donner un nouvel
exemple du sang-froid et de la grandeur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
d’âme, dont elle a fourni déjà tant de
preuves en ces jours douloureux. Acceptons
provisoirement le sacrifice qui
nous est imposé. Retirons nos drapeaux
pour éviter des conflits, et attendons
patiemment l’heure de la réparation.”</p>

<p>The beloved tricolour was hidden from
sight, but after the departure of Max, even
the wearing of a tiny button or bit of ribbon
presenting the colours, became a crime
punishable by imprisonment. Women
had these roughly dragged from their dress
in the street by any passing officer who
wished to make a public exhibition of
power, and one whom I know was ordered
by a young stripling wearing the Prussian
uniform, when seated opposite her in a
tram, to hand over a tiny brooch whereon
the three colours were scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the grief that swept
through the city when the Belgian flag was
put away. It was as though the prisoners’
last connection with their king and happy
prosperous past were broken. Even the
children felt it; one saw them, when no
German was in sight, drag a faded bit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
tricolour ribbon from their pockets and
wave it in gleeful defiance of a government
that had robbed their young days of all
happiness, and later ground down so many
of them through poverty to death.</p>

<p>Gradually the adamant walls of oppression
closed more narrowly about us, and
the pervading mood became subtly affected
by crafty German efforts to kill hope.
Prisoners we were, and prisoners likely to
remain for indefinite time, with a monster
for gaoler pitiless as he who guarded the
“cellar of the dead” at the ill-famed
Luxembourg. Indeed, the moral and physical
misery to which the people of Brussels
were soon reduced was probably not less,
measured by duration, than the concentrated
horror of those September days
during the first French Revolution. Streets
never actually flowed with blood, but
many a life was extinguished on that
crime-stained spot where Miss Cavell was
placed before a wall and shot in secret;
many a mind was crazed in futile efforts
to save an innocent son, father, or brother.
It was not for days the people of Belgium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
suffered, but for months that dragged on
into years of ever-increasing oppression
and tragedy.</p>

<p>But daring courage and heroism were
not lacking. Many a man, still unknown
to fame, risked his life for his country within
the city walls; many a woman of high
standing, secretly serving her nation,
scorned peril and drained a cup of moral
anguish no less repellent than that drunk
by the Marquis de Sombreuil’s daughter—a
cup, to speak figuratively, not seldom
containing the life-blood of those dearest to
her. It cannot be pretended that all whom
the Germans suspected were innocent, but
Prussian astuteness was usually more successful
in trapping the guiltless than the
guilty. Fretted by failure, the Germans
vented their passion on these innocent
victims, in order at least to obtain the advantage
of a terrifying example.</p>

<p>Despotism waxed strong and incredibly
barbaric, when every Teuton was
swelled to bursting with pride and the
Allies seemed helplessly retreating before
the onrush of his mighty legions. Petty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
laws, senselessly fretting, were imposed on
the people of occupied Belgium. Citizens
were ordered indoors at seven p.m., all
shops and other public places had to be
closed and street lights extinguished, often
without reason given; sometimes as punishment
for the refractory act of some peasant
whose very existence was unknown to those
who paid the penalty. In Bruges and
other towns, citizens were forbidden to
walk on the pavement which a German
officer happened to be traversing, and had
to salute him deferentially from the centre
of the street.</p>

<p>In time all liberty was extinguished,
and efforts were made even to suppress
the French language. Flemish, closely
related to German, and consequently offering
a means of facilitating future control of
the country, was ordered to appear first on
all public announcements and documents,
legal or other; also tram conductors were
obliged to announce the names of streets
in Flemish. The privacy of homes was
invaded with or without excuse, while of
course all correspondence, even in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
city, and any other writing, was subjected
to the severest censure.</p>

<p>The English language was looked upon as
an affront to the enemy. Even we neutrals
were made to feel it objectionable to speak
our native tongue in public because of
the Teuton hatred of England, for an
English word affected the invaders as a
red rag does a bull. Had they dared
then to offend America, which would have
forced them to feed the Belgians themselves,
they would no doubt have officially forbidden
it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">AFTER the battle of the Marne, the
incredible outcome of which we only
learned days later through secret outside
sources, the spirit of Brussels revived a
little, and the people’s wonderful, almost
unreasoning, confidence became stronger
than even before the occupation. Gradually
the city began to assume a more
normal aspect; certain cafés reopened
and many shops, also street trams were
run at unsatisfactory intervals. But
existence was constantly haunted by
the knowledge that every act and look
was watched by the ubiquitous spy in
civil dress eagerly seeking an excuse to
drag a citizen to the Kommandantur.
No one dared speak aloud of topics uppermost
in the minds of all, or betray in
public by so much as a glance his knowledge
of that great victory which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Germans endeavoured to conceal. The city
walls became more universally papered
with <i>affiches</i> curtailing liberty, or announcing
penalties inflicted upon well-known
citizens. “<i>A la peine de mort</i>,” in enormous
lettering that could be read several
yards away, frequently attracted crowds
to read the names of friends or prominent
men condemned to death for such faults
as later on, when Germany was less confident
of becoming the world’s master,
were punished by clement terms of imprisonment.</p>

<p>As neutrals, we were not personally
troubled in this respect; but several of
our friends were inexplicably arrested
and sent to confinement either in
Germany or Belgium. The cause of
these arrests in many cases was never
known, even by those who suffered them,
only to be liberated after a term of
months or years of cruel confinement in
cells. In other instances the cause for
arrest was given out with the usual non-appreciation
of right—as in the case of
Count de ——, a well-known banker of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Dinant, who was shot because he declined
to yield the savings of working-class
Belgians when the contents of his safes
were demanded. Three other prominent
men were dragged off to Germany, merely
because they had raised a fund for some
starving labourers, who, having refused
to work for the Germans, had no
means of support. Numerous incidents
of inconceivable brutality, though of
character now too commonly known to
bear repetition, were related to me by
those who endured these punishments.
Such was the experience of a Belgian, the
Mayor of Haux, who told us verbally how
he had been chained to a mitrailleuse and
made to go forward before the German
troops facing an Allied attack.</p>

<p>In regard to the Teutonic hatred
for everything English, the following
ridiculous instance will show to what
extremes German tactlessness attempted
to carry its usurped authority. One day a
number of Alimentation-Commission men,
all Americans, were seated together in a
café; and, as all mention of the war was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
by their own decision, prohibited, were
jovially recounting reminiscences of
happier times. Not far from them sat
five young officers stiffly upright in gilt-buttoned
parade dress and high red
collars. They constantly turned their
sheared heads to cast severe glances at
the merry group who, though noting the
angry eyes flashing under pale, knitted
brows, paid no attention. Even then,
although the Marne had checked their
confident and boastful progress, all
members of Germany’s army, however
young or inexperienced in action, assumed
the bombastic manner of world-conquering
Napoleons and, as in this case,
considered themselves endowed with right
to suppress anyone whose behaviour displeased
them. Under the very evident
irritation of these five fresh products
from the great central war-factory, the
Americans’ hilarity grew apace; but on
account of the Commission they represented,
care was taken to avoid the least
offensive word or gesture that might
excuse interference. Presently one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the Prussians arose—a fat, pale youth,
whose bright blue jacket and trousers
appeared likely to burst if he took a long
breath—and swaggered toward them with
important jangle of sword and spurs.</p>

<p>“You shall not speak English where
officers of the German army are seated!”
he ejaculated, through lips pale and
quivering with rage.</p>

<p>“Indeed? Why not?” inquired one
of the party, an athletic creature who
could have pounded the little fatty to a
pulp.</p>

<p>“Because <i>I</i> say it!” was the reply;
“the English language is distasteful to
us, and should be officially forbidden in
Brussels.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t!” retorted the other in
Americanized German; “and I guess
Uncle Sam would have something to say
if you tried to stop us speaking our own
language.”</p>

<p>“You are all Americans?” demanded
the Prussian, raising his tow-coloured
head, like a proud bantam-cock, and
taking them in with a supercilious glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>No one replied, for the youth who first
spoke to him had turned nonchalantly to
continue his interrupted conversation with
a companion.</p>

<p>“I ask are you all Americans?” repeated
the bantam, his voice rising to a
thin, high note, on which it broke.</p>

<p>“Yes, we <i>are</i>!” shouted another of
the party, a hot-headed boy, fresh from
college, who had had all he could endure
of this inexcusable intrusion; “what have
you to say about it? We are here to
help feed the people you’re starving!—the
people you’ve ruined! And by Gad!
if you try to stop our yap, you’ll get more
than is good for you! Get out! or——”</p>

<p>One of the older men laid a hand on
him and whispered: “Shut up, will
you! What is the use of making a
row?”</p>

<p>“Well, I shan’t be bullied! Because
they have cannon and all manner of
shooting things ready at hand, they think
they can bullyrag the lot of us!”</p>

<p>“We are all members of the American
Relief Commission,” another announced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and called the officer’s attention to a
badge they all wore.</p>

<p>“<i>S’gut!</i>” muttered the intruder who,
while probably not understanding all
that had been said in English, evidently
recognized defiance. “But don’t talk
so loud in public!” he added, turning
away.</p>

<p>“We’ll talk as loud as we like!”
bellowed the defiant one, who understood
German and now made an attempt to
speak it. “And you can’t stop us! We
are not here as your slaves, <i>wissen Sie</i>!
We’re neutrals, but we stand for right!
We stand for—for” Failing to find
the desired word in German, he fell back
on his own language and added in a
crimson passion: “D—— little swine!
I’d like to rub his face in the mud, where
it should be!”</p>

<p>His loud voice had attracted the attention
of others, and fearing to have scandal
brought upon the Commission, his companions
endeavoured to quiet him, and as
soon as was consistent with dignity, got
him out of the café.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately this incident occurred when
the Prussian eagle had lost some tail-feathers
and was hunched up a bit and
on the moult. Otherwise even though
natives of a country then neutral, these
boys might have been dragged by armed
men to the Kommandantur, which would
probably have brought about serious
trouble and consequent difficulties for the
Commission.</p>

<p>Even German women in the city evidently
considered it a proof of loyalty to
their hate-preaching ruler to resent hearing
the language of a race that had frustrated
his ambitions for world-power. On one
occasion when two young American
women were seated in a tram talking
quietly in their native tongue, they
noticed two women opposite who glared
at them inimically. Presently one called
her companion’s attention to them, and,
catching their puzzled glance, remarked,
quite loud in German: “Isn’t it <i>tactless</i>
of them to speak English in Brussels!”</p>

<p>Tactless! to speak a language dear to
the Belgians, while the German tongue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
was racking their poor, harassed nerves
every moment of the day!</p>

<p>That winter was one long series of pitiless
impositions, and the execution or
imprisonment of helpless inhabitants.
Persons, in many cases afterwards proved
innocent, were seized on the merest suspicion,
or on the false information of an
enemy—not only the suspected one, but
his entire family and every friend who
innocently called at his house, not knowing
of his arrest.</p>

<p>At times, in punishment for some individual’s
act, or because “<i>La Brabançonne</i>”
was sung by a party of patriots on the
Belgian King’s fête-day, the few cafés
doing business were closed, and we ordered
to retire to our homes at sunset for one
week or more. Occasionally such a command
was given upon a trumped-up excuse
in order that military movements could
be carried out unperceived.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, flashes of hope gleamed out
in encouraging rumours, coming no one
knew whence, but spreading like wildfire
through the city. Many, many times we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
heard from <i>la laitière</i>, <i>le boucher</i>, or <i>la
blanchisseuse</i> how the Germans had been
driven back into Belgium and were preparing
a hasty retreat to their own land!
Even as early as March 1915 their retreat
from Brussels was represented as being so
imminent that we were all anxious to secure
one of the sentinel-boxes, striped with the
German colours, which stood before all
public buildings and were said to be for
sale. These were desired as souvenirs,
such as no inhabitant of Brussels would
have wished for two years later, when the
iron of oppression had gone too deep for
anyone to want a reminder.</p>

<p>The Austrians were said to be <i>hors de
combat</i>, finished, even before Italy entered
the conflict! Germany was pictured as
obliged to meet alone forces that she could
not resist for more than a week! Then
came news of Austrian victories, followed
by the fall of Mort-Homme, and hope
sank again to despair.</p>

<p>A short time later, refugees from a town
on the Belgian border reached Charleroi,
and word was brought that the Allies had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
taken the former town and were advancing
rapidly toward Brussels. We at once
began to prepare for them, and to welcome
the young King back to his own! For
days a wild but suppressed joy throbbed
through the capital. Champagne was
drunk in secret, with tears of glad emotion,
to King Albert, the British, and the French.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to state how many
times during the first two years these glad
tidings thrilled our hearts, only to be contradicted,
after long suspense, by some
disastrous event, proving that little or no
progress—such as we could then understand
as progress—had been made by the
Allied forces. During that period, when
France and England were obliged to lose
time (since the former was organizing
what strength she had, and the latter
forming an army), we did not comprehend
how strongly the enemy was rooting
himself in occupied territory. We thought
that, since the Germans had been so
wonderfully checked at the Marne, it was
only a matter of short time before they
would be wholly worsted and we liberated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
In those days, consequently, no news
seemed too good to be true, and we accepted
all with delighted confidence.</p>

<p>From our town residence close to the
Bois, we could hear the constant thunder
of cannon, and during days of happy
anticipation it was music to our ears.
Often we would stand listening to it, with
a party of friends, exhilarated by the roar
of some heavy gun that seemed to be
hammering open the gates of our prison—seemed
like a mighty voice crying,
“We are coming, we are coming—have
courage!”</p>

<p>But when, time after time, good news
proved false, that distant thunder became
a torture to the nerves, and horrible to a
mind capable of picturing, even dimly,
the massacre and destruction it signified
week after week, month after month.
Often, during the night, it made the house
tremble to its foundations, and set windows
and ornaments rattling in such a manner
that sleep was impossible. At others, the
resounding earthquaking shocks gave
place to a steady, terrific roar, like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
constant rolling of heavy wagons over a
stony road. This continued hour after
hour through whole nights and days—the
frightful “curtain-fire” eye-witnesses
have so well described, whose ghastly
thunder was in our ears when we fell
asleep, and when we awoke, like the monotonous
roar of an angry sea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, life in the capital continued
to be harassed by local tragedies and
insupportable restrictions. Among these
tragedies were the murders of Miss Cavell
and Captan Fryatt, the condemnation
of well-known and loved citizens to death
or long periods of <i>travaux forcés</i>, the
seizure of some friend’s son, husband,
mother, or sister, often on unproved suspicion,
and, in other cases, because of brave
effort to serve their unhappy land.</p>

<p>One of these—a Belgian woman of good
birth—told me the following story. She,
Madame de X——, and her daughter had
undertaken to forward certain valuable
information to the Belgian army, and convey
orders from the absent Government to
those representing it in the capital. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
daughter, Madame de Z——, a clever and
charming young widow, managed, at great
risk, to cross into Holland for this purpose,—the
frontier was then less strictly
guarded than later,—taking and bringing
back documents of the most perilous character.
The whole affair was managed
with exceptional daring and skill. Not
one of their most intimate friends suspected
upon what they were engaged, and
all precautions were planned beforehand
in case of detection. Despite the number
of German spies in both Belgium and
Holland, Madame de Z—— crossed the
frontier three times without, apparently,
being suspected; but on the morning
following her last trip, the affair took a
more tragic turn.</p>

<p>That morning, after consigning the
smuggled papers to her mother (who was
to look them over and deliver them),
Madame de Z—— left her home in order
to convey a verbal message, which could
not be entrusted to writing, to a man of
prominence then engaged upon matters
of vital importance to his country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>On returning from her mission an hour
later, Madame de Z—— was shocked to
perceive, when some distance away, that
her house was surrounded by soldiers
with fixed bayonets. For a moment she
hesitated, fearing for her mother; but
as the latter could not be gravely suspected,
she concluded that the men had
come in search of herself. Confident
that Madame de X—— could meet the
situation with cool-headed sagacity, she
decided to hide, and allow her mother
to explain her absence, as agreed in case
of investigation.</p>

<p>Since the event was one constantly
dreaded, they had planned to meet it in this
wise: Madame de Z——’s married sister,
who closely resembled her, was to live at
their château in the country until all had
been accomplished, and detection need no
longer be feared. In case Madame de
Z—— should be suspected, she, if she
could escape capture, was to go to her
sister’s town residence and pass as her
sister, stating that she herself, Madame
de Z——, was residing in the country, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
had been there long enough to prove an
alibi. The sister, meanwhile, was to wear
clothes identical with her own, a matter
not likely to cause comment, as both were in
deep mourning for the latter’s husband, shot
with other civilians at Francorchamps, near
Liège, where they passed their summers.</p>

<p>Consequently Madame de Z—— hastened
to her sister’s house, and explained
in part her danger to the old butler, a
loyal creature who might well have been
entrusted with the whole secret. But
Madame de Z—— could run no risks, and
allowed him to believe she and her family
were under suspicion because of vengeful
sentiments openly expressed after her
tragic bereavement.</p>

<p>The mother, Madame de X——, was
unfortunately occupied in looking through
the perilous papers when the Germans
arrived at her house. So absorbed was
she that the sound of hurried steps in the
corridor failed to arouse her. She raised
her eyes from the documents only when a
panting housemaid entered the room without
knocking, and whispered excitedly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
“<i>Les Allemands, Madame!</i> they are
now mounting the stairs!”</p>

<p>There was no time for escape, no time
even to conceal the papers; for two
officers—to whose summons another maid
had responded—after demanding to see
Madame de Z——, ignoring the response
that she was not there, glanced into a room
on the first floor, then rapidly strode up
the stairway.</p>

<p>Though paling slightly on hearing this,
Madame de X—— quickly gained possession
of herself.</p>

<p>“<i>Bien</i>,” she said aloud, “let them come
in,” and added low: “Go out, Jeanne,
and watch for my daughter; warn her
not to return.”</p>

<p>While speaking, she slipped the papers
under the embroidered cover of a small
work-table by which she sat; on this she
set a work-basket, took out a half-finished
bit of embroidery, and was calmly engaged
with it when the officers appeared
at the door, bowed, and entered.</p>

<p>“We wish to see Madame René de
Z——,” said one, the superior; “and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
as we know she is in this house, any
attempt to conceal her will only make
matters more grave for her and for you.
You are her mother, I believe, Madame
de X——, <i>n’est-ce pas</i>?”</p>

<p>Madame de X——, with well-feigned
astonishment, stared at the speaker before
replying: “I am Madame de X——,
Monsieur, but my daughter is not here.”</p>

<p>“Good! You will not be advised;
then we must search the house.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I have no power and no
wish to prevent you; but may I ask why
you wish to see my daughter?”</p>

<p>Without replying, the officer, who had
been speaking French, said something in
German to his companion. The latter
retired, and going below, called in two of
the soldiers on guard without. With these
he began a systematic search of the house,
from cellar to garret. Every cupboard,
drawer, and wardrobe was opened and
ransacked, every bed and table looked
under; even garments hanging in wardrobes
were taken out and examined, as
was afterwards related with much amazement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
by the maid, who imagined that
Madame de Z—— was the sole object of
their search!</p>

<p>Meanwhile the officer who had addressed
Madame de X—— remained
behind, standing with hat on, his small
blue eyes fixed keenly on her refined,
naturally pale face, which wore a serenely
dignified expression of troubled wonderment.
Her white hair, beautifully
dressed, the lines of sorrow that marked
her well-bred countenance, and her mourning
raiment dignified the rôle of innocence
she played with admirable ability, while
her nerves were strained to their utmost
tension by the knowledge that proof of
her guilt lay within reach of this man’s
hand!</p>

<p>“You ask why I wish to see your
daughter,” he said when they were alone.
“Good! I shall tell you: your daughter,
Madame, is a spy!”</p>

<p>He watched the effect of this purposely
abrupt statement and saw a look of
shocked amazement come to his hearer’s
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>“A spy! What do you mean?” she
gasped. “<i>Savez-vous ce que vous dites?</i>”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. She is precisely that! We
have incontestable proof that Madame
René de Z—— has crossed the frontier
twice, with important information for
the enemy, and has brought into this city
written matter from the former Government
of Belgium.”</p>

<p>Madame de X—— stared, then smiled
wanly. “Ah, Monsieur, I fear you have
been very wrongly informed. However
eager my daughter and I might be
to serve our unhappy land, alas, women
of our station have not the nervous
strength, even had we the courage for
such deeds!”</p>

<p>“You may be ignorant of the fact; I
trust you are, for your own sake; but
your daughter has shown both the
strength and the courage. She has done
this thing; we know it beyond all possibility
of doubt, and not only she, but you
and all related to her must pay the
penalty unless you confess. Confession
now will save you much suffering.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame de X—— took up the embroidery
that had fallen with her
hands; “I may be physically weak,
Monsieur, and unfit for daring deeds,”
she said quietly, “but, had a daughter
of mine done that with which your
suspicions honour her, no fear of pain
would force me to confess.”</p>

<p>“Your daughter must suffer the death
penalty; do you realize that?”</p>

<p>“<i>Bien</i>—if I could believe her capable
of doing this thing for Belgium, even her
death and mine would not dim the pride
of my last moment. But, oh, Monsieur,
I only ask let us not be sacrificed without
the glory! Let proof be found before
we are made to suffer as I know others
have suffered.”</p>

<p>“Madame, I have told you we have the
proof.”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>“Of your daughter’s guilt.”</p>

<p>“May I ask what proof?”</p>

<p>“It is known that she crossed the
frontier on the sixth of last month, and
returned on the tenth; she crossed again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
on Monday of this week and returned
last night, bearing papers which are now
in this house.”</p>

<p>These statements, although not quite
correct, were startlingly near the truth;
but Madame de X—— betrayed no sign
of their effect upon her.</p>

<p>“My daughter Amelia!” she ejaculated.
“But, Monsieur, she has not been
to this house for over a month; she is
heart-broken and dwells in absolute retirement
at our château beyond Boitsfort.
Ah, doubtless you are ignorant of the
catastrophe she and we all have lately
suffered!”</p>

<p>“<i>Ja—ja!</i>” interrupted the officer,
stirring uncomfortably; “I know her
husband incurred his death by rash and
guilty action. In these times mercy can
be shown to no one who is guilty.”</p>

<p>Madame de X—— raised her head and
fixed on him a pair of scornful dark eyes.
“Her husband, Monsieur, was innocent
of the smallest crime; he did not even
know your troops had entered Belgium.
He was shot, it was said later, to avenge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
a stupid peasant’s act! If my daughter
is to suffer the same fate, then, I beg of
you, extend your vengeance to me; for
such sorrows craze the mind and are
likely to make criminals of the best
of us!”</p>

<p>Although, unlike Madame de Z——’s
husband, who had done nothing, the
speaker was aware of her own guilt, her
words expressed the bitter grief that
enabled her and her daughter to risk
their lives, not only to serve their country,
but to avenge a crime that had broken
their hearts.</p>

<p>“My dear Madame,” returned the
officer, somewhat impressed by her
sincerely tragic tone, “there is no
question of vengeance in this matter.
Indeed, my sympathy is so greatly with
you, I should gladly serve you to the
full extent of my power. It is, I know,
dreadful for a mother to see her loved
child condemned to be shot as a criminal,
unable even to bid her a last farewell.”</p>

<p>The woman’s hands trembled slightly,
but, noting it, she took scissors from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the work-basket and calmly cut the silk
from her needle, rethreaded it, and
began work on another flower as she
remarked quietly: “I cannot anticipate
such a horror on false evidence. Surely
you will take time, you will investigate
the matter thoroughly before condemning
her!”</p>

<p>“Naturally; but before we leave this
house positive proof will be in our
hands.”</p>

<p>She glanced up, apparently mystified.
“A proof you will find here—in my
house!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame; the papers your
daughter brought here last night.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” She smiled again, the pathetic
mirthless smile of baffled innocence. “If
those papers are here, Monsieur, you have
full liberty to find them.”</p>

<p>“Where did your daughter go to-day?”
he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Which daughter?”</p>

<p>“Madame de Z——”</p>

<p>“I had no idea she had gone anywhere.
Surely if she left the château she would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
come to see me! Her sister was here
last night and said nothing of my daughter
Amelia having left the country.”</p>

<p>“Her sister is Madame de R——, is she
not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame Charles de R——.”</p>

<p>“And she was here to see you last
night?”</p>

<p>“She passed the night with me, as I
was not well, and returned early this
morning to her house on rue de Bellevue.”</p>

<p>The officer grunted and, for the first
time, looked away from her, glancing
thoughtfully about the room.</p>

<p>Madame de X—— noted the change in
his face, and, after some moments of
silence, said quietly: “Will you not be
seated, Monsieur?” and indicated a chair
near her.</p>

<p>He sat heavily, laying sword across his
knees and remarked, after a pause: “This
is a sad business, and very distasteful to
me.”</p>

<p>“I can well imagine so, Monsieur,” she
returned, with a touch of irony he did not
notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you would be absolutely frank, I
am sure the matter might be smoothed
over—at any rate the punishment might
be less severe. The idea of a woman
being shot is appalling; I should like to
prevent that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if justice be done I have no fear
of such an event. But if a woman be
guilty it is my conviction, Monsieur, that
she should suffer even as a man. Women
<i>have</i> been shot here in Brussels; among
others, the Englishwoman, who died so
bravely, and Gabrielle Petit.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ach, ja!</i>” He stirred again, and
looked at the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Her crime was far less than that you
accuse my daughter of,” pursued Madame
de X——; “therefore if Amelia were
guilty, I could have no hope, Monsieur;
and surely nothing could make me more
frank than I have been with you. I have
sought to hide nothing; you may search
where you will, and may even send for
my two daughters to corroborate what I
have said.”</p>

<p>At this moment the other officer appeared,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and announced, in German, that
his search had been fruitless.</p>

<p>“Good!” muttered his superior, rising;
then, addressing Madame de X——, said
formally:</p>

<p>“I must demand to search this room,
Madame.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she replied; “here are the
keys of my desk and the cupboard.”
She took two keys from the pocket of a
small black silk apron she wore, and
handed them to him.</p>

<p>The soldiers were then bidden to enter,
and the search began. Not only was her
desk examined and every letter in it
opened, but each volume in the book-cases
was taken out and looked through;
the cushions and upholstery of sofa and
chairs were examined; the carpet was
pulled up at the edges, and every cranny
and crevice, where a paper might be
hidden, investigated.</p>

<p>And all that seemingly endless time
Madame de X—— sat listening to the
wild beating of her heart, thrilled through
with terror as one or other of the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
approached the little table where the
papers they sought lay hidden only by a
flimsy embroidered cover!</p>

<p>Had her hair not been white, it would
certainly have become so during that
period of moral anguish and suspense;
but, in recounting it, Madame de X——
affirmed she was scarcely conscious of
peril; the strain was so intense she lost
sight of its cause and seemed to suffer
more physically than mentally. Each
movement of the men acted painfully
upon her nerves, and though her hands
still moved, mechanically plying the needle,
her very muscles seemed to stiffen; she
felt petrified and unable to move her
head or body.</p>

<p>The men did their work in silence, but
she could hear their breathing, and now
and then a cough or throaty sound that
shocked her like the discharge of a gun.
During the whole procedure she noted
that the superior was secretly watching
her; and, fearing he might detect terror
in her attitude, she made a mighty effort
to change it easily. But she dared not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
rise from that table, whereon lay the
price of her daughter’s life and her own.</p>

<p>When everything had been examined to
the chief officer’s satisfaction, he muttered
something to his men, and, approaching
Madame de X——, laid his hand on <i>the
little table</i>!</p>

<p>“What is in this, Madame?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“That?” she replied, with a calm that
surprised herself; “only embroidery-silks
and things of that sort—it is my work-table.”</p>

<p>“There is a drawer in it, <i>n’est-ce pas</i>?”</p>

<p>“No, Monsieur, it opens at the top.”</p>

<p>Though this was the crisis of all, Madame
de X—— stated that a strange calm of
indifference came over her; a conviction
that the end had come gave her the
recklessness of despair.</p>

<p>The soldiers, at that moment, were busy
replacing books in the bookcase; the
other officer, at her desk, was putting
together certain letters of wholly innocent
character he thought might be of service
later on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should like to look into the table,
if you please,” said the chief.</p>

<p>“<i>Bien.</i>” She lifted her work-basket
and, handing it to him, said: “Will you
kindly set that on the other table?”</p>

<p>As he, while examining the basket’s
contents, turned to do this, she swept
the table-cover with the papers under it
into her lap. Scarcely was this done,
when he turned; and quickly lifting the
lid, she remarked, looking up innocently,
with the smile now familiar to him: “Its
contents are not likely to interest a
soldier, I fear.”</p>

<p>He put his hand in and felt through
the silks, then drew it out quickly, pierced
by a needle!</p>

<p>“Good!” he said harshly, his face
reddening. Then, when the pain passed:
“Thank you, Madame. So far we have
found nothing incriminating, but nevertheless
you must come with me at once
to the Military Governor.”</p>

<p>“Go with you!” she gasped, fearing
to rise because of those papers in her
lap;
“but why, Monsieur? For what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
reason do you arrest a woman of my age,
against whom you have no charge?”</p>

<p>He raised his shoulders. “Our reasons,
Madame, are not usually given. You
must be imprisoned until this matter is
fully investigated; that is all I shall say.
If you wish to go to your room to dress,
you may do so; but I must ask you to
be as quick as possible.”</p>

<p>The unyielding dryness of his tone told
her argument would be futile, and, in a
last desperate effort to save the situation,
she gathered up her apron, in which lay
embroidery, table-cover, and papers, and
left the room in proud silence, determined
to benefit by the moment of privacy
allowed her, and destroy the papers.
The officer, after ordering one of the
soldiers to examine the chair she had
occupied, said something to the other,
who, with him, followed her from the
room.</p>

<p>As she mounted the stairs, Madame de
X——, to her horror, perceived that the
second soldier mounted close in her wake.
This she knew meant ruin! It meant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
that the last possible chance to rid herself
of the fatal documents was to be denied
her; for, taught by the experience of
others, she knew every inch of the
apparel she wore or discarded would be
minutely examined. Consequently, by
some means or other, the soldier must
be prevented from accompanying her to
her room. A plea for consideration, however,
was not likely to be granted, and
rebellion would only incur greater severity.
She paused and glanced back, thinking
frantically what to do. Suddenly an idea
came to her.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” she said, with obvious
embarrassment, “this man <i>cannot</i> accompany
me! You have examined every
inch of my house; you have cross-questioned
me and my servants, and read
my intimate letters! Everything has
been freely yielded to your investigation,
therefore I must beg you to recall this
man for a little moment. I am an old
woman; I have urgent need of a moment
of privacy.”</p>

<p>“Good!” was the colourless reply;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
“He will await you in the corridor and
accompany you to your room.”</p>

<p>This being all she could hope for, and
more than would have been accorded had
her acting been less perfect or the slightest
clue discovered, Madame de X——, followed
by the soldier, went on to the
floor above. There the soldier, looking
bored and miserable, awaited her by the
door of a small compartment at the end
of the corridor.</p>

<p>One moment later those documents
which the enemy would have prized—which
would have condemned Madame
de X—— and her daughter to death—were
driven, by a resounding rush of
water, into oblivion down the drain-pipe!</p>

<p>But their contents she retained in her
memory, and later found means of communicating
them to those for whom they
were destined—I believe during her imprisonment,
but am not sure of this
point.</p>

<p>The consequence of her heroic courage
was the exoneration—after painful and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
lengthy imprisonment—of both women,
as no proof could be found of their guilt.
But it is doubtful whether condemnation
to death could have caused more anguish
than Madame de X—— suffered during
those hours of desperate peril! Among
the many great deeds of Belgian heroism
few are more deserving of admiration than
the brave and clever fidelity of these two
daring women to the confidence reposed
in them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">ALTHOUGH time passed somewhat
less dully than later, the incidents
that, during the winter and summer of
1915, relieved our otherwise monotonous
days were of such distressing character
that they only deepened the gloom. One
by one our British friends were carried
off to Rühleben, while their wives were
left behind without sufficient means—in
some cases absolutely destitute, since
they could receive nothing from without,
and were consequently worse off than the
really impoverished Belgians, for whom
charity provided. For months at a
stretch, this monotony of misery was
broken by nothing more encouraging
than bad news from the front, and the
tragic events at the <i>Tir National</i>, where
citizens were shot for patriotic deeds,
seldom graver than that of Miss Cavell,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
or the brave Belgian girl Gabrielle Petit,
twenty-one years of age. She, however,
was given a chance of having her punishment
commuted to imprisonment, but
declined this favour which had been denied
the Englishwoman. The murder of Miss
Cavell caused a pervading mood of mourning
that seemed unlikely ever to diminish,
even in those who did not know her
personally. That crime, so pitilessly
carried out, in secrecy and under cover
of false promises, was perhaps most
appalling to those in the vicinity whose
hopes were stimulated by misleading
assurances, until the post-mortem announcement
proved them vain! Although
a British subject has referred
to the deed as rather a “blunder” than
a crime,—she being proven guilty of having
assisted young men across the frontier,—the
fact that other women, not British,
found guilty of the same humane, although
forbidden, acts, were yet spared the extreme
punishment reserved for spies and
the worst of treason, takes all logic from
the argument of this apparently prejudiced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Irishman. Edith Cavell’s martyrdom
impressed us in Brussels, as it must
always impress history, not only as shortsighted
stupidity—the very determination,
secrecy, and haste with which it was
perpetrated contradicts such interpretation—but
rather as a deliberate and
atrocious act of vengeance toward a hated
nation!</p>

<p>But other tragedies followed so quickly
that this one gradually became lost in
the mass of appalling incidents related
by relatives of those who suffered, or
widely announced in German <i>affiches</i> in
order to strike fresh terror to the hearts
of a sorrowing and helpless people.</p>

<p>Yet hope lived on; despite the prevailing
misery, each gleam of good news
that reached us from the front was
magnified to a great victory for the
Allies, and twenty-four hours sufficed to
develop the conviction that a glorious
and triumphant peace was about to be
proclaimed.</p>

<p>Secret organizations in Belgium occasionally
brought us a ray of encouragement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
despite the twenty thousand German
civilians endeavouring to discover and
destroy these sources of information opposed
to what was allowed to appear in
our papers. But, by dint of passing
from mouth to mouth, the news became
so distorted or exaggerated that one
scarcely knew what to believe.</p>

<p>We all had maps spread over our
walls, on which every mile that the
British and French advanced was marked
with pins bearing little flags of the
nations. For how many months—<i>years</i>,
indeed—we pored over that line as it
crept closer and closer to St. Quentin,
Cambrai, and other points considered
the keys to a rapid and overwhelming
victory! I cannot recall them without
painful recollection of our many disappointments.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1918 we put those maps
out of sight, and ceased reading the communiqués
vouchsafed us by a German press.</p>

<p>The most trying element of all, in
regard to the front, was the <i>authentic</i>
information we received by word of mouth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
as early as December 1916, of the taking
of Courtrai, St. Quentin, etc., by the
Allied armies. The stirring account grew
as it passed from one excited recounter
to another. It was originally obtained,
as stated above, from some unknown
but trustworthy source. But later on
we came to believe that these stories
were, in great part, spread by the Germans
in order to weaken and destroy what faith
and hope still survived in the country.
I heard soldiers, even at this time, express
very gloomy views as to their nation’s
prospects in the war. Once in a tram,
just before the last temporarily successful
onslaught of the Germans at Verdun, I
heard one, who pretended he was drunk
and had possibly been taught the words
in French, cry out hysterically: “Our
cause is lost! <i>Nous sommes fichus!
Nous sommes fichus!</i>”</p>

<p>For some reason beyond the comprehension
of civil minds the occupying
Government appeared bent upon destroying
every vestige of hope in Belgian
hearts. Invariably on the eve of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
German victory, exhilarating rumours
of great Allied successes were set forth
from unknown sources awakening joy in
the prison city which often verged on
an outburst of dangerous enthusiasm.
Then, as invariably, the blazing blue
<i>affiche</i> appeared, announcing an overwhelming
defeat of the Allies in the very
section where they were understood to
have been successful.</p>

<p>The subtle trickery of such tactics
might in time have attained its object;
certainly there could be no better method
of wearying and torturing a people into
losing faith. And while it did not succeed
with the better classes, it tired and
broke the spirit of the suffering poor to
such an extent that, even when positive
proof of successes reached us, they would
not believe; for they had come to the
conviction that the Germans were invincible
and would never give up an inch
of Belgium.</p>

<p>We who had witnessed the easy and
rapid advance of the enemy through
Belgium and deep into France, cut off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
as we were from all reliable information,
could not, during the first years, form any
idea of the vastly differing conditions
affecting the Allied armies. As the
Germans, opposed only by hastily-mustered,
unorganized, and infinitely
weaker forces, had swept on so quickly,
we looked for like speed from the Allies
when once their strength was massed
and ready. That the enemy had had
time to root himself in and fortify his positions
almost invulnerably, while England
was forming an army of untrained men,
and France was preparing hers, we did
not comprehend until later. Few details
reached us from the outer world, although
during the first year a London <i>Times</i> was
occasionally smuggled in. A <i>Times</i>! No
one outside can realize what that meant
to us! The poor sheet, usually more
than a week old, passed surreptitiously
from hand to hand, was reduced to a
flimsy rag before reaching its last reader!
Enormous prices were paid for it. The
members of the Anglo-American club
paid a hundred francs for one copy which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
contained nothing of importance, but
was nevertheless of inestimable value to
us as a voice from friendly regions whence,
week by week, we were further cut off.
But soon these rare and precious journals
appeared no more; and the apparently
innocent newsvendors who shouted
aloud: “<i>La Belgique!</i>”—and whispered,
when someone known to be trustworthy
passed: “<i>Le Teems, Monsieur?</i>”—no
longer added the zest of dangerous intrigue
to our saunterings through the
dull streets.</p>

<p>But tales of heroic deeds done by the
Belgians afforded a certain interest and
satisfaction; tales only whispered to
those who could be trusted not to repeat
them. And many were performed
by the Flemish, whom the Germans
boasted they had won to their side. One
may be given to illustrate the real sentiments
of these people, so falsely represented
in the German accounts. At
Bruges, where the Flemish element predominates,
an old man, for many years
foreman in the unloading, etc., of canal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
boats, approached my friend the steel
manufacturer in that town, gruffly complained
that the Allies were making a
mistake in bombarding the railroads
from aeroplanes, since the Germans were
shipping their ammunition and so forth
exclusively by the canal, and asked the
manufacturer if there was no means of
sending them word to this effect. The
latter, not wishing to betray himself,
but meaning to attempt it, said he knew
of no such means. Whereupon the old
Fleming withdrew, muttering discontentedly,
with bowed head and great
bushy brows knitted over a pair of clever
dark eyes, meditating mischief.</p>

<p>A few hours later, German officers came
in hot haste to the manufacturer, and, in
a frenzy of rage and excitement, made
him accompany them to the canal.
There a great crowd had gathered about
the old foreman, who was under arrest,
and threatened with death. He appeared
stupidly indifferent to the menaces and
curses heaped upon him by the infuriated
Teutons, merely repeating over and over:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>“I could not help it!—An accident!—I
did my best!”</p>

<p>For some moments my friend, dazed
by the reigning confusion, was unable to
understand what it was all about, until,
led by an officer to the canal bank, he
saw the cause of their rage. He was so
much affected by amusement mingling
with a deeper emotion that a lump rose
to his throat, and he could not speak.</p>

<p>The old foreman, as though by accident,
had managed to let drop the hook of his
great iron crane just as a boat, carrying
a vast German war-cargo, was passing by.
It caught the boat so firmly by the nose
that, in his pretended efforts to free it,
he not only overturned the bulky vessel,
but dragged down his crane, which, with
the boat, sank into the canal, blocking
it against all navigation for nearly
five weeks! He did this at the risk of his
life, and only his able pretence of stupidity,
and the manufacturer’s representation
that he was in his dotage, won for him
a term of imprisonment instead of the
extreme penalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>The brave passage of young Belgians
over the frontier to join their army caused
the barriers of our prison to be more
closely guarded. Those who still ventured
to cross—and there were many
even after the deadly electric wires had
been installed!—did so with scarcely
a chance for their lives. Boys as young
as seventeen ran the gauntlet of that
“death-zone,” and many passed it in
safety after incredible endurance and
suffering.</p>

<p>A Belgian woman, whose two sons
made a daring attempt to pass, told
us their experience, related to her in
part by one of their companions, obliged
by illness to return; and in part by the
German officer who coldly informed her
of their fate.</p>

<p>After skulking for four days and nights
under cover of a wood in the Campine,
devoid of food, save what little they
carried in their pockets, and exposed
to incessant autumn rains, they at last
reached a canal lying between them and
Dutch territory. Having no other means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
of crossing, they plunged at night into
the black water, and struck out for the
opposite shore.</p>

<p>The mother, not hearing of their
capture, which would have been widely
published, concluded, after several days,
that they had got over safely. But one
morning she was startled by the visit of
a German sub-officer who came to announce
that one of her sons had been
shot while swimming the canal.</p>

<p>As she pretended ignorance of his
intention to cross, the information was
considered sufficient punishment, especially
when, several days later, the tidings
of her other son’s death in like manner
was conveyed to her by the same pitiless
messenger.</p>

<p>This was the most tragic incident of
the sort I heard first-hand at that time;
but tales as sad, or others picturing the
glorious success of such young heroes,
were constantly circulating.</p>

<p>Later, when the electric wires and
underground mines were installed, the
matter was differently managed. By a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
carefully-organized plan, the boys were
able to pass over in companies of twenty,
thirty, and more at a time, each one
contributing his share to the large bribe
by which the sentinels were bought off.</p>

<p>Once, when, before this rare privilege
was wholly withdrawn, my companion
was permitted to go by motor into
Holland on business, he was surprised
to meet, in the little Dutch town of
Nispen, a Belgian acquaintance whom
he believed to be in Brussels. He and
thirty companions had been safely conducted
over the frontier the night before!
Three thousand one hundred francs, one
hundred from each member of the party,
had secured them this easy passage.
The youths, now free and eager for
revenge, were glad to regain liberty at
so small a price, and be able to join their
colours. While he was relating this in
the street, he noticed a crowd gathered
about two German soldiers, unresistingly
arrested by the Dutch police.</p>

<p>The young Belgian, on seeing them,
uttered an exclamation: “<i>Mon Dieu!</i>”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
he said. “Those are our sentinels!—the
men who led us over last night!”
They hastened to the group, and the
soldiers, recognizing him, grinned and
nodded in a friendly manner.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” he asked
them genially, for the men were evidently
good-natured creatures, not reared in the
army, whose military sympathies were
apparently no deeper than their uniforms.</p>

<p>“Got tired of it over there!” returned
one, still smiling. “We are not so free
as you are, but we can wait for that more
comfortably here than in Belgium!”</p>

<p>During the summer of 1916 the inhabitants
of Brussels, weary of suffering and
the “hope deferred which maketh the
heart sick,” began a rather forced effort
to brighten their existence. When, after
a bitterly gloomy winter, the first peep
of green became visible in the Bois, it
seemed as though a tremor of new life
passed through the city. War, with its
ever-recurring calamities and disappointments,
had come to be looked on as an
unalterable affliction, which must be endured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
with patience until some unforeseen
and unimaginable event should bring it
to an end. Confidence in early and rapid
victory had gradually given place to a
less definite though stubborn belief in
final triumph; but now even this was
less openly expressed. War, in fact, became
a tacitly avoided subject of conversation.
The tedious communiqués,
giving only such details as the Government
thought fit to present, were no
longer discussed, even by bereaved and
serious folk whose thoughts were ever at
the front. We who, as yet, were spared
the crape worn by so many, began to
frequent tennis and golf clubs, where,
while healthfully exercising on the courts,
or “chasing a pill through a pasture”—as
the Irishman defined golf!—we tried
to forget that the air we breathed came
to us over acres of death.</p>

<p>The Bois became alive again with
children and pleasure-seeking couples;
and although there were no horses to
drive or ride, boats were launched, as of
old, on the beautiful lake surrounding an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
island café, which reopened its doors to
serve, not the dainty repasts of former
days,—edibles were far too dear!—but tea
and coffee of sorts, while procurable, and
a light home-made beer. One lump of
sugar was allowed to each cup, and no
appeal or bribe could secure more. But
in a short time the place was crowded,
not only by Belgians, but German soldiers
who mingled freely with them, seeking
relief from the dull routine of their days
of rest.</p>

<p>One of the touching sights of this little
island retreat was that of these weary,
battle-soiled men, to whose clothes still
clung the mud and grime of the trenches,
delightedly visiting the dovecot, where,
for ten centimes, they procured grain to
feed the pigeons. These pure white birds,
emblems of peace and beauty, would settle
on their hands, shoulders, and heads;
and through their snowy plumage the
men’s gruesome, green-grey uniforms appeared
like the thought of an evil mind,
marring the spiritual accord between God
and man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>This reawakening of the people was a
natural reaction—the demand of life for
its own rights. As with individuals,
sorrow’s tedium had evoked in the entire
occupied country a certain helpless
resignation to circumstances that after
two years’ patient endurance and discouragement
offered no promise of change.
Oppression and deprivation had become
permanent elements of existence. Tragedies
even failed to impress us so deeply
as of yore; incidents of heart-breaking
pathos no longer brought tears to the
eyes of those who could still dress warmly
in winter, and indulge adequately, if not
luxuriously, in the high-priced food. All
had made such sacrifices for the poorer
classes as each considered possible without
serious menace to himself. Many had
given the last centime they could spare,
others substantial donations which they
probably did not miss.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, evidences of distressing
want increased, more especially among
those too proud to ask alms, who, before
the war, had been comfortably off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>During that summer and the following
winter these once well-to-do and industrious
citizens swelled the long lines of
hunger-driven, ill-clad beings who, in rain,
snow, or sunshine, stood for hours outside
soup-kitchens to obtain the loaf of bread
and jug of hot broth provided by charity.
I think no visible sign of the country’s
calamity was more painfully impressive
than the sight of those silent, patient files
of heterogeneous humanity, extending at
certain hours along whole blocks of the
city’s streets. Chiefly were they eloquent
during the early dusk of winter, when,
exposed to the blast of cold winds, to
sleety rain, or penetrating fog, refined men
and women, old and young, stood shivering
side by side with the lowest inhabitants
of rue Haute!</p>

<p>Some faces seen in those sad gatherings
I shall never forget; faces of haggard,
hopeless men, whose brave efforts to live
honestly had been frustrated when success
was almost attained; of wan women,
whose husbands were dead or fighting in
the trenches, whose children starved in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
heatless home; old women and young,
in whose eyes all human reasoning was
eclipsed by an animal hunger—old men
and young with that same anguish in their
eyes, but with the hard and morose expression
of embryo criminals lurking about
their down-drooping, sullenly closed lips.</p>

<p>Ah, only those who lived in the midst
of Belgium’s agony, who beheld a guiltless
people verily crucified as recompense
for their loyalty to honour and truth, can
fully appreciate the wrong that was done
them! Only those who saw with their
own eyes the callous and inhuman rage
of the invader’s earlier treatment,—when,
confident of conquering a startled world
with every diabolical device of destruction
which mind could conceive, he ignored all
laws, and deliberately aimed at crushing
the very heart of this little land that had
done no wrong,—only those can understand
with what contempt, what <i>loathing</i>,
we who did witness it came to look
upon the ruler and the chiefs of that race
whose history has been thus stained!
For we saw these people starving while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Germany was seizing their crops, their
horses, cows, even the contents of dry-goods
and other shops; shipping away
the coal, for need of which so many
perished during the cold winters; taking
all fats, so that butter was unprocurable
and milk too rare and dear for the poor
to buy. We beheld the famished mothers
struggling to keep their fading children
alive on what charity could provide—so
small a portion for each of the many
thousands to be cared for!—the country’s
youth stricken down with tuberculosis, and
honest men driven to thieving and crime!</p>

<p>Indeed, the bare sight of those lines of
hunger-wan creatures, stretching like black
stains through the city, awoke depressing
conjectures as to whether man’s intelligence
was, after all, of a higher order
than that of beasts, or merely the same
limited capacity, artificially burnished!
Through nearly two-thirds of the civilized
world, life, beauty, and the harvests of
ages were being ruthlessly and insanely
destroyed; every principle of right, every
element of higher sentiment scorned or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
ignored, in a senseless and hideous conflict
between men—between the most
exalted of all living creatures! Truth,
the acknowledgment of a higher Power,
and even kindred sympathy—manifested
even by the lowest animals—were sacrificed
day after day to an atrocious passion,
costing millions of lives, billions of wealth,
and a loss in treasures, in architecture,
literature, and art such as a thousand
years of labour can never replace!</p>

<p>What wonder that individuals did not
escape the almost universal retrogression,
and that, amid a people who had so nobly
stood loyal to their ideals, dishonesty and
contempt for law gradually developed
from the festering and unalleviated wounds
unjustly dealt them!</p>

<p>Signs of this inevitable consequence of
war became apparent later, not only in
Brussels, but throughout the whole of
Belgium, as in Russia and (more or less)
in all the involved nations.</p>

<p>War! who after this can ever again
insult patriotism by relating it to the
beat of drums and the roar of cannon?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Every rational being who has witnessed
its dire and degrading effects, even in so
small a scene as the prison-capital of its
vast tragic stage, must curse those philosophic
minds of Germany who exerted their
intellects to exalt intellect’s most horrible
opponent, and sold their souls to the
devil for a vain Emperor’s praise!</p>

<p>On them, as much as on him they
flattered, must be laid the crime of a
catastrophe that has menaced the very
foundations of civilization. Where now
can be seen the benefits of that “drastic
medicine for the human race” which
Treitschke informs us must always recur
by the Almighty’s will? He pretends
that war is elevating because the individual
disappears before the great conception of
the State, and that to check war would
be “a perversion of morality,” in that it
would abolish heroism! Is heroism more
beautiful or advantageous when <i>forced</i>
from a man on the battlefield, than when,
of his own will, he proves it in a peaceful
struggle to live righteously and let others

<p>How many criminals, for selfish objects,
have evinced personal courage like that of
a soldier in action?—far greater, because
not in obedience, but in opposition to
power! Paid or commanded heroism is
not heroism in the true sense. Thousands
upon thousands in the peaceful walks of
life have more worthily deserved glory
by labour and sacrifice for the common
good than they who are driven, under
command, to slay their kind—who obey
for no clearly-comprehended object, but
first and foremost to preserve themselves.
There are perhaps fifty men in five hundred,
apart from the officers, whose dominant
incentive in battle is other than self-preservation;
whereas in peace one-half,
if not more, of a like body of men utilize
their physical and intellectual powers for
the improvement of general conditions—and
often without aiming at other recompense.
The hour for lauding the soldier
above the scientist and artisan is long
since past, and vast military power, or
military power of any sort, is a mockery
of the present glorious age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Can there be any more absurd sophistry
than that of pretending that war corrects
egoism? War is bred of egoism, bred of
the cruellest of all egoisms—imperial
ambition! In peace the basest selfishness
is less harmful than the selfishness of
international conflict. Even those men
who have amassed enormous fortunes by
robbing the poor have been of greater
benefit to the world in general than if
their intelligence and force had been
utilized in planning how to crush another
nation. Egoism, after all, is necessary
to progress, and war is but its most
barbaric expression.</p>

<p>Machiavelli’s assertion that power is
the keynote of all policy has been grasped
by the German war-philosophers, who
flatter themselves they see clearly when
looking upon the present epoch through
the eyes of an unscrupulous fifteenth-century
Italian. Machiavelli perhaps
spoke truth for his time—a truth, moreover,
still real for our own; but his word
<i>power</i> has now a different significance.
Now only is the power of reason generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
developed; now only the many nations
of the world speak the same moral
language; now only the masses, formerly
forced to be war-like animals, are thinking
and, to a great extent, cultured beings.</p>

<p>But what is the use of reiterating what
every thoughtful mind has heard crying
to-day over the bleeding earth? That
Reason which vast catastrophes invariably
rouse to ephemeral life soon dies in the
gathering storm-cloud of humanity’s innately
savage passions! If the race most
boastful of its culture, a race which leapt
so rapidly from the confining narrowness
of old-time heresies, could give birth to
the devastating horror that has reigned
for nearly five years, and threatened to
thrust the world back into medieval darkness,
what faith can be placed in mere
Reason? What faith can be placed in
any human argument, ideal, or belief—what
faith in Man himself?—The majesty
of human intellect, before so deliberate a
destruction of its own works, is made to
appear no more than a vain invention of
fancy; and the supreme creature of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
knowable creation appears of no more
enduring significance than as depicted
by Lamartine: “Ce pauvre insecte c’est
l’homme, qui chante quelques jours devant
Dieu sa jeunesse et ses amours, et puis se
tait pour l’éternité!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">WHEN the spring of 1916 was in full
leaf an unexpected pleasure was
accorded us: permission from the Governor
to ride bicycles within certain stated
limits! The privilege was welcomed almost
joyously by all; for, since there
were no horses and no means of transit
for those living in the suburbs, or those
out of touch with such trams as were
running, many workers were obliged to
walk miles each day to and from their
places of occupation. Besides, the
pleasure-hungry inhabitants—doomed to
remain summer and winter within the
gloomy city—were glad of a chance to
make excursions into woods and open
country without expense or too great
fatigue. Every man, woman, and child
able to pedal immediately planned how
to purchase a wheel, although many were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
only able to do so after a long period of
saving—by cutting down their food supply,
and other sacrifices. There were, of
course, not enough bicycles in the country
to meet even one-tenth of this suddenly-created
demand, since most of the Belgian
stock had been requisitioned for army
purposes. But no sooner was the cheering
permission given than the market
was flooded, as though by magic, with
wheels of all styles and all prices—<i>made
in Germany</i>! Every shop was stocked to
overflowing, sold out, and restocked with
incredible rapidity.</p>

<p>In a short time the Bois, so long deserted
and melancholy, presented a scene
of life that did the heart good to see.
Hundreds of bicycles, all bearing the
Teuton trade-mark cleverly disguised,
rolled gaily over the smooth asphalt of
wide avenues, where the splendid automobiles
of former days no longer deterred
the timid; where, at that time, not even
a German car or vehicle of any sort
impeded their way.</p>

<p>So great was the pleasure and benefit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
afforded, especially to wan, under-nourished
shop-girls and lads, in sad need
of fresh air and some diversion in their
joyless existence, that one was tempted
to feel more kindly toward the occupying
Government, until, later on, the subtle
and selfish aim became known of this sole
act of seeming consideration. Nevertheless,
during those summer months a surprising
spirit of comparative gaiety developed.
The conflict raging without
seemed temporarily forgotten. Young
and old indulged to the full the delight
of wheeling along smooth cycle tracks
(laid before the war) through leafy woodlands
out to Groenendael and other
picturesque spots in the environs, where
restaurants, that had done no business
for two years, gladly welcomed them.</p>

<p>Whole families were to be seen awheel;
fathers and mothers, accompanied by
children of all ages. Loving couples, even
elderly women and white-haired men,
experienced the first semblance of pleasure
and liberty since the 20th of August 1914.
On Sundays, especially, this manifestation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of reawakened life was delightful to see.
From morn till eve the city avenues and
those of the Bois were moving streams
of radiant cyclists, eager to leave the
town behind and taste the sweetness of
summer under fragrant boughs, or in
flowered fields where they would settle
in parties for luncheon. Jeanne from the
<i>laiterie</i>, Jacques from the butcher’s shop—hundreds
of poor, tired young creatures,
who slaved on weekdays to provide
themselves and war-widowed mothers with
the necessities of life, were all there,
smiling and forgetting the sacrifices made
to procure a cheap German wheel—sacrifices
often betrayed in their hunger-pinched
faces! But the privilege was not
indulged in only by these; the aristocrats
welcomed it as gladly, and innumerable
smart men and women, deprived of their
horses and cars, pedalled along by the
side of Jeanne and Jacques as contentedly
as they.</p>

<p>I have no exact knowledge of how many
bicycles were sold in Belgium during that
summer; but judging by the fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
one was procured by every individual in
the capital able to ride and scrape together
the price, many thousands must
have been sold in Brussels alone—all provided
by Germany! A large number of
the poorer classes could not save the
necessary sum until the summer was over,
and cold, bad weather prevented them
enjoying their hard-earned acquisitions.
But they had something to look forward
to for the coming summer, should the
war continue—and there was then little
prospect of it coming to an end!</p>

<p>These last, unfortunately, made their
sacrifices in vain; for no sooner was
everyone provided with a wheel, and the
enormous demand, so cunningly created
and provided for, had been satisfied, than
the moment arrived for the sequel of
Germany’s clever commercial <i>coup</i>!</p>

<p>Immediately an order was published
that everyone possessing a bicycle should
not only declare but <i>deliver</i> his tyres, as
the rubber was needed by the army!
Riding was forbidden, even to those who,
after yielding their tyres, asked permission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
still to enjoy their wheels by using
tyres of rope!</p>

<p>Thus was solved the mystery of that
one instance of kindness towards a wronged
people! The German army secured the
rubber without robbing its own nation;
and, moreover, enriched certain home
manufacturers with the pathetic savings
of many a Belgian girl and lad, since
fallen a victim to tuberculosis—an epidemic
then already beginning to ravage
their country’s youth!</p>

<p>Of course the usual excuse was given
for checking the use of bicycles: someone—who
and how was not revealed!—had
abused the privilege, therefore all
should be denied it! But if, indeed, that
abuse ever was committed, it must have
been during the first weeks after permission
to ride was given. No one,
anxious to serve his country, or to escape,
would have waited until the last importation
of wheels had been disposed of!
This, moreover, did not explain why permission
was never again given, although
during the two following summers there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
was no conceivable reason why those who
asked to ride with rope tyres within a
certain limited locality should be refused.</p>

<p>The whole affair was an abominable
trick, subtly clever, with that sly and
treacherous cleverness which won a vast
advantage for the German army in the
beginning, and has ever since characterized
its policy.</p>

<p>The dark months of winter crept upon
us; another joyless Christmas approached—a
day suggesting not peace and good-will,
but rather blasphemous mockery of
all that Christ taught. One black day
was like another, always throbbing with
the more or less loud roar of distant
cannon, stirred only when good news
fanned to brief flame our almost extinguished
hope. Only this, and the ever-new
laws imposed by the enemy, made us
realize we were yet alive, and roused us
sufficiently to note what the day of the
month might be.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, we were awakened
at dawn by a thunder of near-by
cannon, and, until taught by experience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
sprang from our beds thinking the Allies
had come. But it was only to see puffs
of exploding shell surrounding a bird-like
form far up in the sky—which we recognized
as a friendly aviator winging through
the explosives toward a Zeppelin shed
rather uncomfortably close to our house.
Once, at dawn, several biplanes appeared
bent upon destroying this monster civilian
slayer. Brussels, still asleep, resounded
to the thunder of cannon from the many
points where high-angle guns were set,
one of these points being a water-tower
two hundred yards or so from us. The
shooting was continuous; and puffs of
smoke, as the shells burst, surrounded the
air-craft so closely it seemed impossible
that they could escape destruction. Fragments
of shell rained upon our roof, and
crashed through the garden trees, while
we, in our night-clothes, leaned from
windows watching the brave flyers through
our glasses. Our hearts almost ceased to
beat, fearing lest one should fall; for it
appeared almost beyond hope that they
could all escape that determined and well-directed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
fire. Presently one descended
into full view, and, after circling about
the Zeppelin shed, slackened speed just
above it. Shells burst round him on every
side, but the intrepid aviator paid no
heed. As we watched, scarcely breathing,
he plunged downward close to the shed—hesitated—then,
apparently in no great
hurry, soared up like a fearless eagle to
safer heights, through a very cloud of
bursting shells. Almost immediately there
was a tremendous explosion, which we
scarcely heeded, so intent were we on his
escape. For what seemed hours, though
it was probably not more than a few
moments, we followed his flight amid a
storm of attack that seemed to miss him
at times only by a hair’s breadth.</p>

<p>In a villa facing ours dwelt a young
American widow, who, with her two sons,
as little clothed as we, was also watching
the combat. One of the boys, as reckless
of risk as he was indifferent to his attire,
had crawled from a window, and stood,
bare-footed, in pyjamas, on the roof
cornice in great danger of being struck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
by falling bits of shell. The widow,
wrought to uncontrollable excitement,
called out as though the daring flyer
could hear her: “For Heaven’s sake
hurry!—<i>Fly!</i>—Oh, they will bring you
down!—God have mercy on him! Spare
him! Spare him!”</p>

<p>Her cries came thinly to us, through
the thunderous din, and, though she and
we all laughed over it later, at that
moment of tension nothing impressed us
as extraordinary or comic. Every sense
was centred on that rising form, until it
finally disappeared in the mist of higher
ether. Had he been brought down we
should have all felt it as a personal
tragedy; for, although at that time
America was still comfortably neutral, we
who had witnessed Belgium’s martyrdom
were little in sympathy with our country’s
attitude.</p>

<p>But this took place earlier; before the
spring of 1917 the Machiavellian intelligence
ruling us is supposed to have devised
a means whereby it hoped to check aerial
assaults upon these cherished perils-to-unprotected-towns.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Although the trick
was beyond all things diabolical, many in
Brussels, taught by experience the inhumanity
of Prussian war-methods, believed
it was done with deliberate intention
to terrify the inhabitants into opposing
Allied aerial attack.</p>

<p>As the Zeppelin, unfortunately, was
absent from its shed when a well-directed
bomb was dropped on it during this
attack, another attempt to destroy it was
made later. During the latter raid several
shrapnel shells tore with direful effect
through the city’s crowded streets. Many
ghastly details reached us, but one account,
given by an eye-witness, will serve to
illustrate the vileness of a scheme which,
if indeed intentional, can only be equalled
by the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i> and that
shooting of the French wounded, openly
recorded in the German papers, under
the heading: “A day of honour for our
troops”!</p>

<p>One of the shells, in its mad career
through the city, struck a brewer’s wagon,
killing the driver, and the oxen which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
drew it, and severely wounded a second
man. A physician in the vicinity
hastened to the spot; and with those
who gathered about the scene of butchery
came two German officers who appeared
already prepared for the event.</p>

<p>“<i>Ach!</i>” exclaimed one of these, in
a tone of compassionate regret; “you
Belgians can thank the British and French
for this! What is it to them how many
innocent beings are sacrificed to their
senseless attacks in a vain effort to cripple
us!”</p>

<p>But, all unknown to the speaker, several
tell-tale bits of the murderous missile,
proving it to be of German origin, had
already been gathered up and secreted
by the Belgians present. The physician
had one of these, and, unable to control
his fury on hearing this <i>malin</i> interpretation
of the tragedy, he turned on the
officer, his face white and quivering with
reckless passion: “<i>Pas du tout!</i>” he
cried; “no French or English hand committed
this crime! Here is the proof!”
He revealed the damning fragment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
“Avions do not drop shrapnel, and neither
you nor anyone can deny where that was
made!”</p>

<p>The officers scorned the suggestion, but
withdrew, for they were unsupported by
others in the midst of a silent but enraged
crowd.</p>

<p>One feature in the affair, which encouraged
the belief that it had been
arranged purposely, was that German
soldiers immediately took possession of
each locality where damage was done,
ridding it of every condemning particle
of shell. But fragments enough have been
preserved by the Belgians as proof of a
deed worthy only of those who committed
it.</p>

<p>In constant view of such trickery how
could a neutral attitude of mind or heart
be retained?</p>

<p>The men of the American Alimentation
Commission came to Belgium as friendly
towards Germany as towards any other
nation. Several of them, indeed, were
somewhat biased in favour of the Prussian
army, and all as prone as were we ourselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
in the beginning, to doubt the
accounts of their atrocities. But before
they left I believe there was not one
whose last trace of respect for the occupying
Powers was not destroyed by what
he had witnessed with his own eyes during
his sojourn in the country. Very many,
as the world knows, lost no time, after
leaving Belgium, to reveal their outraged
sentiments by joining the Allied forces.
Even before America came in, several of
these gave their lives in fighting a wrong
they were forced to recognize, despite their
original determination to view all from
a fair war-basis, and not be influenced by
mere hearsay.</p>

<p>And yet these men were more closely
associated with the German officials than
with Belgians. Their duties necessitated
constant intercourse with the Government,
and with those whose influence might easily
have counterbalanced Belgian accusations.
Those stationed in the <i>étape</i> regions were
constantly accompanied by a sub-officer.
Day and night each had his “nurse,” as
the boys called these military supervisors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
at his side; ate with him, travelled
with him, and slept near him! What
more natural than that so intimate an
association should strengthen their original
admiration for the German army? But
facts were too flagrantly against it. Little
by little incidents, at first regarded as
awful but possibly legitimate features of
war, led to others, illegitimate and of
enraging significance, gradually destroying,
in these fair-minded men, all sympathy
with the Central Powers.</p>

<p>As year followed year they saw these
<i>soi-disant</i> defenders of their “<i>Vaterland</i>”
bleeding a helpless country, and clinging,
at all cost and by any means, to territory
won through the use of poisonous gas
and burning oil—brutalities never before
known, and all fore-prepared, while the
world was dreaming of peace!—saw them
draining broken Belgium by outrageous
taxation, and requisition of every kind,
while doing their utmost to create internal
strife between the Flemings and Walloons.</p>

<p>Very few neutrals at first could gauge
the situation correctly in Brussels, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
German argument and German lies were
predominant. It was only their <i>actions</i>
that opened our eyes, and the extraordinary
advantages they so quickly attained,
which gave evidence of an inexorable and
vandalistic plan that could not have been
brought to such perfection in a few months,
nor even in a few years.</p>

<p>Only a fool or an all-forgiving angel
could have lived under that domination
and retained sympathy or respect for the
nation it represented. Although noble
individuals in Germany were probably as
adverse as we to its pitiless barbarity and
craft, the fact that no united voice in that
great and prosperous country was raised
against it, suggested that their number
was too small to be of any avail. The first
easy victories, the violation and crushing
of a neutral land, seemed to have eclipsed
the soul and intelligence of a people formerly
so proud of their culture.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">THE winter of 1916-17 proved more
trying even than that preceding it.
After the tyres were taken, came a demand
for copper, and everyone was ordered to
convey to central depôts all the specified
articles he possessed in this metal.</p>

<p>This meant, for Belgians, not only the
deprivation of kitchen utensils and other
things necessary to a household, but, even
more bitter, it meant providing the enemy
with material to slaughter brothers and
friends. Consequently every means was
resorted to to avoid obedience, without
incurring the drastic punishment promised
all who resisted. Copper was hidden
under floors, in carefully-replastered and
repapered walls, under the earth in gardens
and under coal in cellars—all such
things as were then demanded, but, alas!
not those demanded a short time later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Treacherous servants rendered this defiance
more perilous, as no one was sure
not to be sold by a trusted butler or valet.
The butler of one woman we knew had
been with her for twenty years; and to
him, as her husband and sons were at the
front, she confided not only the hiding of
copper but the fact that a younger son with
her aid had crossed the frontier. He rewarded
her confidence by insolently ignoring
his position as servant and assuming
an attitude of equality with her. Every
order she gave was referred to another
servant, while the butler sat comfortably
in the drawing-room, smoking cigarettes
in her presence! We ourselves were
obliged to unearth our carefully buried
copper at midnight and rebury it in
another place owing to the dismissal of a
gardener who had assisted at the first
interment! Not that he threatened to
betray us, and more than likely he would
not have done so, but the consequences
were too serious to risk.</p>

<p>Examples were made of those found to
have hidden their copper, who not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
had every particle of the metal taken, but
in some cases were pillaged of all valuables,
fined, and imprisoned. Neutrals
were not exempt, and a story was told me
of a Swiss family who offered resistance
when their home was invaded by armed
soldiers. After ordering the men out,
they threatened to send for Belgian police,
and were at once subjected to the most
abominable treatment. Every ornament,
lock, and door-handle of brass or copper
was wrenched off; chandeliers were ruthlessly
dragged from the ceilings; and the
soldiers, after causing general havoc,
announced, on departing, that a van
would come the following day to take
away piano, pictures, and other things of
value. I cannot say if this threat was
carried out, nor can I vouch for the story,
as it came to me third-hand. But I myself
witnessed one of these plundering
raids, when a Belgian’s house was entirely
gutted, and can relate the experience of a
Greek family told me by the daughter,
whom I knew well. They too, as neutrals,
ignored the order to deliver their household
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
goods, and, since they had not
attempted to conceal them, were astounded
when the soldiers arrived.</p>

<p>“Why do you come to us who are in
no way implicated in the war?” demanded
the Hellenic matron; and the plunderer
replied: “That is of no consequence; all
must obey, neutral or not neutral! We
need the copper, that is enough.”</p>

<p>“But I need it too!” argued the lady.
“What am I to do without my pots and
kettles? It’s an outrage to treat Greeks
as you do your enemies!”</p>

<p>“Greeks!” roared the soldier; “what
have the Greeks done for us? If they are
not fighting us to-day, they will be to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“But we are really your allies!”
ventured the lady, changing her tactics;
“although Greek by birth, my husband
is a Turk by adoption.”</p>

<p>“Good!” was the reply. “If you are
our allies you should yield <i>everything</i>
without a murmur, and should have done
so long ago. Since you have not done this,
which it was your duty to do, we shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
take everything you possess in copper or
brass—even your ornaments!”</p>

<p>And they did! There were few Belgian
houses more thoroughly robbed of
the desired metal than was the house of
these <i>pretended</i> German allies!</p>

<p>The ever-dreaded visits from soldiers
were like swords of Damocles hanging
over our heads. No one dared leave his
house for any length of time, for fear of
returning to find it ransacked and looted,
and himself perhaps under arrest because
a forgotten <i>Times</i> or other forbidden
literature had been discovered. An innocent
conscience did little to allay this fear,
as many persons were imprisoned on the
slightest excuse. Even when liberated
later, they had every detail pried into
of their private life, correspondence, and
financial circumstances, besides being
held in close confinement and intense suspense
for two or three weeks, often much
longer.</p>

<p>One entire family we know, a family
of high standing in Brussels, was arrested
upon suspicion, not excepting the delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
mother. She was confined in a cell
for seven weeks, pending investigation—which
failed to find any proof of guilt
on her part or that of the others. Neither
they nor anyone knew why they were
seized, save that the son was suspected
of having received or passed on the
<i>Libre Belgique</i>. After a trial that led
to no definite verdict of guilt the family
was liberated, but obliged to pay a fine of
twenty thousand marks!</p>

<p>Not only were suspected persons
arrested, but their close friends and
everyone who innocently happened to
call at their homes after, or at the time
of their arrest.</p>

<p>In the offices of a business friend of
ours, an employé failed to appear one
morning, and a young girl typewriter
was sent to his house to learn the reason
of his absence. As she did not reappear,
another employé was sent in quest of
her, who also did not return. In the
afternoon the typewriter’s mother came
to inquire why her daughter had not
gone home for dinner at midday; and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
on being told whither the latter had
gone, she hastened to the absent clerk’s
house, fearing some calamity had befallen
the girl. When she too failed to
return, our friend’s mystification became
apprehension. He appealed to the police,
who informed him all had been arrested
as possible accomplices of the suspected
clerk, who was afterwards proven quite
innocent, and liberated.</p>

<p>Such circumstances naturally kept everyone
in a state of nervous tension.</p>

<p>A rather interesting and significant
fact in regard to these raids was the
change of demeanour shown by those
obliged to do this work during the second
copper requisition in the autumn of 1917.
These men were late recruits, usually
young fellows, dragged from honourable
occupations to serve their bitter time in
the trenches, and forced to perform this
distasteful service during intervals of
rest. At the house of an acquaintance
of ours two soldiers of this type very
politely asked permission to search for
copper, entered, looked about in a half-hearted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
manner; then, after grunting,
“<i>S’gut; hier gibts nichts</i>,” said they
were very tired, and asked permission,
which was granted, to lie on two sofas in
a back sitting-room and sleep for half an
hour!</p>

<p>Our place was raided at this period by
two such tired lads, fresh from the trenches
and expecting to return to action in a few
days.</p>

<p>When they first entered one assumed
an autocratic manner, made rather
ludicrous by his frail physique and boyish
countenance; but, after we exchanged
with him a few words in his
native tongue, this bearing disappeared.
The two looked through the house indifferently,
and, as all metal such as
they sought had been hidden, found
nothing. They kindly hinted, however,
that some brass beds and gas-heating installations
would be taken at a later raid
should they be found there!—a hint we
acted upon at once. Some few articles
of silver remained in the dining-room for
daily use;—the rest was secreted, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
many families, on one excuse or another,
had already been robbed of their silverware.
One, a finely-worked fruit-dish,
purchased as solid silver and, as we
thought, not likely to be seized, because
of the workmanship, was subjected to a
damaging filing process which revealed
it as heavily plated on copper. Although
the amount of copper contained
was certainly too insignificant to be worth
having, the fruit-stand was claimed, and
noted on a card to be called for later.
However, it was hidden, and one of less
artistic value set in its place before that
predicted call!</p>

<p>It is only fair to conjecture that many
instances of inexcusable brutality to
which the Belgians were subjected were
caused by a stupid fear, on the
soldiers’ part, of not strictly obeying
orders, rather than by any individual
wish to cause pain; although in some
cases it was quite the opposite.</p>

<p>During the first year of war a rather
amusing incident occurred as proof of
this. At that time certain neutral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
business men were allowed to go to
and return from Holland by motor. They
were provided with special passes. Two
friends of mine, who were associated in
business, usually made the trip together.
But despite their possession of passes
signed and stamped by the German
Government, they were held up at the
frontier, and subjected to galling examination
and insolence by a new batch of
officials lately installed. As these unnecessary
and lengthy delays greatly impeded
my friend’s affairs, he complained
at headquarters. But the Prussian
chiefs could not be persuaded that he
was not exaggerating the difficulties, and,
after assuring him his passes would serve
him better in future, put the matter out
of mind.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, on his next trip my friend
and his companion experienced the same
detention and bullying at the hands of
these frontier officials.</p>

<p>The former again complained; and, as
his word was still doubted, asked that
an officer in civil dress might accompany
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
him on his next trip and witness for himself
what took place.</p>

<p>This being granted, he, with his
associate, and a young Prussian officer,
disguised in plain clothes, drove together
to the frontier. On arriving there they
were—as usual—held up, ordered to leave
the car, and enter a bare waiting-room.
Here their papers were taken from them,
and, while the officials in charge disappeared
on pretence of examining these,
they were left sitting in the cold compartment,
guarded by two armed
soldiers.</p>

<p>One quarter of an hour passed in silence;
their accompanying officer made no comment.
But when more than twenty
minutes went by without the least sign
of deliverance, he became restive, glanced
at his watch several times, and looked
black. Moments had stretched to close
upon an hour when the disguised military
chief, having until now shown the self-control
of discipline, brought his clenched
hand heavily down on the wooden table
by which he sat, and exclaimed loud,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
“<i>Aber, das ist unverschämt!</i> What the
devil are those men——”</p>

<p>Before he could finish the sentence, one
of the soldiers on guard seized him,
bellowing, “What’s that? You speak
insolently of German officials? Good!
We’ll soon teach you manners!”</p>

<p>At a sign, the other soldier approached;
the two burly creatures grasped their
helpless superior before he could utter a
word, and dragged him to an outstanding
lock-up house, where, thrusting him into
a corner, they proceeded with their punishment,
two against one, striking him even
in the face with their brutal fists, and
permitting him no chance to speak.</p>

<p>The officials, attracted by the loud
voices and scuffle, reappeared just after
the enlightened German had been dragged
out.</p>

<p>“<i>Was ist los?</i>” demanded one, looking
about.</p>

<p>“Your men are about to kill that chap
out there,” said my friend, who, with
his companion, galled as they were by
the unfairness of the attack, had refrained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
from interfering. To have done so would
have expressed contempt of military discipline;
moreover, they were secretly
pleased that the officer should have his
eyes morally opened, if physically closed,
by blows intended for a civilian guilty
only of an impatient exclamation!</p>

<p>“<i>Ach!</i>” returned the official, shrugging
his shoulders; “if they are beating him
he deserves it!—that’s our orders. We
submit to no resistance here!”</p>

<p>“Very good,” returned my friend;
“but have you looked at that man’s
papers? Do you know who he is?”</p>

<p>“Bah! What’s that to me?” returned
the surly brute, who held the still unexamined
passes in his hand. “Our discipline
is indifferent to rank; he may be
who he may!”</p>

<p>“If you glance at his papers you may
think differently;—he is Lieutenant von ——, aide-de-camp
to General von ——.”</p>

<p>The official stared; his mouth fell open.
“Eh?” he articulated in his throat, too
astounded to utter a word; then, nervously
dropping other papers to the floor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
he sought the officer’s pass, read the
signature, and, followed by his colleague
and the others, rushed for the lock-up
house. It was then that my friend saw
the helpless lieutenant, pressed into a
corner, being brutally pommelled by the
two soldiers.</p>

<p>Poor man! he was a sight to behold
when he joined them later—nose distorted,
one eye swollen and blackening,
and several ugly cuts on his face.
He said very little when rejoining his
companions; but, judging by the meek
demeanour of the bully officials, some
truths had been told them they were
not likely to forget, which made it clear
they would pay dearly for carrying their
habitual abuse of authority into the wrong
camp!</p>

<p>The lieutenant, as they pursued their
journey, could not refrain from smiling
at the comic side of the affair. He appeared,
however, morally shocked, and
the few remarks he made suggested this
significance: “The German man is a brute
at heart!” When in authority, he certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
appears so, especially when endowed
with military power—the sacred
fetish of his race!</p>

<p>It was under the constant menace of
similar treatment that the inhabitants of
occupied Belgium existed. Galled by
pitiless impositions; denied all freedom
of action or word; robbed and deprived
even of home privacy; spied upon and
never knowing on what false charge one
might be arrested, one could do nothing
but endure. Rebellion would have been
unavailing against armed forces, and only
cause additional misery to others.</p>

<p>One of the pathetic sights of the
“copper winter” was to see well-dressed
women carrying some treasured object in
copper or brass, concealed in a neat
package, to be buried in some friend’s
garden. Even sadder was it to view the
military depôts for the collection of household
necessities or ornaments. Bronze
statues (one Belgian, with pleasure, sent
a bronze bust of the Kaiser—which was
returned to him), gas-fixtures, handles
of doors and bureaus, clocks, stair-rods,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
curtain-bars, etc., were hurled, pell-mell,
in a great heap before the grieving eyes
of those despoiled, who were paid four
francs a kilo for the metal, in whatever
beautiful and artistic form. And these
things—the sole fortune of many—were
to be utilized to slay their husbands,
brothers, fathers, and sons! No wonder
every effort was made to defy the command,
and that some even melted their
things rather than yield them!</p>

<p>This the enemy failed to understand.
With native lack of sensitiveness for
other people’s feelings, the Germans argued
that, as Germany had made the sacrifice,
Belgians should do so as readily! That
was always their reply to appeals for
consideration. They appeared quite blind
to the fallacy of such reasoning, but took
pains to announce in their home papers
the Belgians were selling their copper in
order to buy food!</p>

<p>That autumn became a season of secret
interments, for not only copper but certain
preserved edibles were buried to escape
the vampire’s greed, and in anticipation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the famine obviously approaching. What
the Alimentation Commission provided
was so little for each individual that
hunger reigned generally, not only among
those who depended wholly on charity.
The latter, indeed, were better off than
many British women and others formerly
well-to-do; and everyone who could sought
to lay by something for a still more trying
hour.</p>

<p>These silent midnight burial-parties
were not devoid of a comic side, despite
their pathetic object. Whole families
gathered in the dark of their gardens, busy
about a yawning grave, wherein a red-glazed
lantern afforded dim light invisible
from the surface. No word was spoken
by the shadowy forms consigning food and
treasure to the earth’s faithful keeping.
All was done in silent haste, in order that
every suspicious trace might be obliterated
before dawn. Bushes and even small
trees were planted above the graves, and
stood innocently smiling in autumn leaf
when the sun arose!</p>

<p>Food grew daily scarcer and dearer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
With the entrance of the United States
into the war it seemed as though Belgium
was doomed to famine. The laying up of
provisions that could not be buried, even
by those who could afford it, was dangerous,
since they were forbidden, and could
not be concealed from the prying eyes of
soldiers likely at any moment to enter
our houses. Consequently the winter of
’17-’18, with a great scarcity of coal and
the probability of being deprived of gas,
was looked forward to with dread.</p>

<p>During the summer every patch of
ground, even road-edgings, was cultivated.
Vacant fields were divided into small
patches and given to the poor to till
and plant; potatoes especially were grown,
for during the preceding winter there had
been a great dearth of this mainstay of
the poorer classes. Now, however, it
was not only the indigent who feared
starvation. The well-to-do and even the
rich anticipated being deprived not only
of the better edibles to which they were
accustomed, but even of necessities. Consequently
flower-beds and lawns of private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
estates were tilled to raise potatoes, beans,
sprouts, etc. Our own croquet-ground
was converted into a potato-patch; the
rose-garden produced cabbages, onions,
and beets, while the tennis-court netting
served to support climbing beans! But
ill-fortune made that summer, in regard
to weather, the worst Belgium could remember
for many years, as the winter
before had been one of the most severe.
Continual rain destroyed a large proportion
of the potatoes and greatly injured
other crops.</p>

<p>It was pitiable to see farmers who, deprived
of their horses,—for the Germans
had taken all,—had tilled their fields, foot
by foot, with spades (the more fortunate
with slow and stubborn oxen), and had
laboured from dawn till dark to make
them flourish, gazing in wide-eyed despair
upon acres of rain-blackened rye or blight-ruined
potatoes. As the Germans claimed
a large percentage of all produce, this
misfortune raised the price of ordinary
vegetables, poor as they were, so high
that only the rich could afford them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
The poor were obliged to subsist on the
two potatoes a day per head which—until
their stock was exhausted—the “National
Alimentation Committee”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> provided.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
“Le Comité National,” Belgian organization for
distributing food-stuffs provided by the American Commission
for relief.</p></div>

<p>Not far from us, on a narrow strip of
grass-land bordering a wood, two poor
women “whose husbands were fighting”
had planted vegetables for their own use
during the winter. They were mothers of
several small children, but despite this
care and their household duties, they were
at work there at the first glimmer of day.
They went home only at midday to procure
the charity soup and warm it for
their children, then returned to labour
until dark. It seemed impossible that
anything could thrive in such a shadowed
place, but a weak crop of potatoes, cabbages,
and beans presently appeared, only
to be partly destroyed by rain, while much
of what survived was stolen later by those
who had no land to cultivate.</p>

<p>However, after the roots had begun to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
form and until the potatoes were ripe,
these women never left the spot unguarded.
One or the other remained
there the entire day and night, rain or
shine, as did all who had unprotected
ground. They erected a primitive sort of
shelter, composed of every conceivable
thing they could find: bits of rusty tin
and old carpets, for the most part, as wood
was too dear and too much needed for fuel.
Ah, they suffered, these people!—suffered
as no one can understand who did not see
their daily struggle to live. Young and
old women went tramping for hours and
<i>days</i> through the woods to gather dry
twigs and bear them home in great bundles
on their backs;—not only the usual poor
wretch, whose patient drudgery so well
serves the landscape-painter, but many
women who were formerly in comfortable
circumstances, now blue with cold and
pinched with hunger, trudged through the
rain-oozing dead leaves of the woods.</p>

<p>Later, they went entirely without shoes,
for all leather was taken by the Germans;
and until wooden sabots could be produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
in sufficient numbers to meet the
demand, women and children were to be
seen with their feet shod only by bits of
carpet and often without stockings. Their
patience under these miserable conditions
was extraordinary. When told they could
have no coal, they made no murmur, but
set out to gather twigs as though realizing
the uselessness of rebellion, and only
impelled by an instinctive impulse of self-preservation.</p>

<p>Many hundreds of trees were felled each
winter for exportation and other German
uses, and the poor swarmed where this
was done, waiting eagerly until each
superb tree crashed to earth, when they
swooped down upon it, like hungry vultures,
each securing what he could of the
lesser branches, to ensure him some
warmth during the cold months.</p>

<p>These hapless creatures, terrified by the
approach of another season of bitter
winds, ice, and snow, gradually became
desperate, and were ready to commit any
crime to obtain food and fuel. Stealing
became more and more common, especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
from landed peasants who, owing to
the high prices they demanded for their
produce, were looked upon as legitimate
prey. To some extent this was deserved;
but the peasant, after working his very
life into the soil, was obliged to resign so
much of his crops to the Germans that he
would have gained nothing had he sold
at normal prices. Potatoes, even in September
of this year (1917), were selling
at three francs fifty and four francs a
kilo, butter at thirty francs rising to
forty-eight later, sugar at twelve rising
to twenty, coffee at ninety, tea at one
hundred and more, while eggs rapidly
mounted from seventy-five centimes to
two francs sixty each; flour, outside the
250 grams allowed for bread, was unobtainable.
The Comitié National provided certain
edibles at a low price, but hardly
sufficient for each individual to keep body
and soul together.</p>

<p>I was told by one of those who assisted
in the difficult and arduous task of dividing
the shiploads sent over from the United
States and elsewhere, that supplies had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to be calculated, most minutely, to the
last box of matches, in order that each
individual in all parts of ravaged Belgium
should have a share. Their labours were
of incalculable worth, and are not likely
ever to be adequately estimated.</p>

<p>As for coal, which the Germans were
shipping from Belgium in great quantities
to their own country, or exchanging for
other commodities, with Switzerland and
other countries, it was only to be had
through the <i>accapareurs</i>. These went
on foot with push-carts to Charleroi, or
were conveyed there by any wretched
beasts they could find, and bribed the
German sentinels to let them return with
small amounts of coal, for which they demanded
two hundred and fifty francs and
more a ton. Even at this price it was
under weight, and mingled with dust and
stones. The use of gas was consequently
greatly restricted. In September an
<i>Avis</i> announced an increase in its
price and a still more trying limitation,
the exceeding of which would be punished
by entire deprivation, not to mention a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
heavy fine. Buildings occupied by Germans,
however, were stated to be exempt
from these restrictions.</p>

<p>The occupying powers seized everything
they wanted. The entire contents
of dry-goods and other ware-shops were
requisitioned; food-stores, when not deliberately
stolen, were bought up in bulk
by the officers, and sent home to their
families in Germany. Even the shooting
of the game with which the woodlands
about Brussels were well stocked was forbidden
to all save the army. The Bois
and adjacent woods resounded, during the
shooting season, with the report of German
hunting-pieces destroying partridge and
pheasant preserves, and that even on
private property; but a young Belgian
lad, caught poaching not far from the
place where we lived, was shot in the act
and left where he fell.</p>

<p>These men with guns cared little for
the sufferings of the unarmed and famished
people under their control, and found it
easier to punish petty opposition to their
laws of greed by a bullet than by trial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
or imprisonment. Their victims were
numerous. One boy, whose family I
knew, was shot and badly wounded for
trying to smuggle from the country two
kilos of potatoes, not for sale, but for the
needs of his family.</p>

<p>Naturally, such conditions led in time
to dishonesty. The people became desperate,
and, finding they could secure food
by risking their lives, presently developed
the idea of gaining fortune by the same
means. Reckless of an existence so rife
with misery, they became more daring;
and then it was that the <i>accapareurs</i>
appeared, by whose courage and clever
trickery the rich, at least, were provided
with edibles that would otherwise have
gone to Germany. These petty smugglers
(not the great ones, who cornered large
quantities of food-stuffs and concealed
them against the hour of dearth) were, in
a way, a God-send to those who could
afford to pay their prices; but their
morals suffered further degeneration when
greater numbers adopted this scheme for
rapid money-making. Their gains, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
were not easily won, as they were
obliged to walk many miles during the
night in all sorts of weather, to escape
the German sentinels who guarded the city
limits and took all butter, eggs, potatoes,
etc., discovered on the smugglers. The
latter concealed their wares most ingeniously,
often in a manner not appetizing
to reflect upon. Butter was packed about
their bodies under their clothing, eggs
were securely secreted in their hats, and
potatoes were carried in sacks under the
women’s skirts and also in their blouses.
For the smuggling of grain a complete
suit was worn, so arranged with pockets,
that the grain was distributed over the
entire body. But the cleverest device
was that of a man who bribed a German
soldier to sit with him on his donkey-cart
and, pretending he was under arrest,
brought in a thousand francs’ worth of
butter and eggs on one journey!</p>

<p>During that winter, when the enemy,
menaced by defeat in the west, was
planning a new and desperate offensive,
unhappy Belgium saw her oppressed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
hungry people degenerating into criminals.
The better sort remained loyal to
their proud standard of honour before
all, but the destitute lower classes, physically
enervated and morally sickened,
came gradually to look with contempt
upon principles so cynically ignored by
those who governed them.</p>

<p>They saw rich and poor alike robbed
with no adequate excuse, saw the country’s
wealth carried to Germany merely to enrich
their enemies.</p>

<p>Even stud-farms were despoiled of those
horses that had been the nation’s pride,
such as the <i>cheval de trait</i>, bred with care,
through many, many generations, to attain
a point of perfection unequalled in any
other part of the world. Those superb
Belgian horses were taken, not for army
use, but to be sold in Germany—as was
announced later on in a German paper.
And not only the young animals, but
champion stallions and mares, especially
those which were pregnant, were seized in
opposition to the appeals of their owners.
To these appeals and to the argument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
that it was understood that the occupying
army should take nothing not essential,
von Bissing replied that, circumstances
being changed, the German Government
was no longer bound to respect its agreements:
(“Les circonstances s’étant modifiées
le gouvernement allemand n’était
plus en mesure de respecter ses engagements”).
The “circumstances”
amounted to this—that Germany had the
country helplessly in her grip, and, foreseeing
final victory, could fearlessly throw
more “scraps of paper” into the face of
her hapless victim!</p>

<p>A German bank commissary, an officer,
entered the business house of a prominent
Brussels firm and desired information
concerning certain transactions. After an
hour or two of investigation, he withdrew,
saying he would return presently
to complete his work. Inadvertently he
left his portfolio behind, and the temptation
to look into it was not resisted by
those who thus had a chance to learn
something of Germany’s secret devices
regarding Belgium. On examining its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
contents, they found a list of all the
foremost business associations in Brussels,
with exact details as to their management,
financial standing, and relations with the
outside world; also the director of each
was mentioned by name and estimated in
regard to his influence and worth.</p>

<p>The important foreign interests of the
firm in question were set forth, accompanied
by a statement that it would be
greatly to Germany’s advantage to obtain
control of the organization.</p>

<p>This was told me by one of the firm’s
head managers, who added: “It goes
without saying we made good use of this
chance enlightenment in order to foil
German designs.”</p>

<p>These intrusions into business houses
were of daily occurrence, but, in some
cases, clever foresight rendered them of
little avail to the subtle intriguers.</p>

<p>In one instance, that of the Public Utilities
Company, “La Financière,” sixty-five
million francs’ worth of Allied securities
(the major part of which were owned by
British subjects) were saved by the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
manager’s sagacity. At the beginning of
1915, two German officers, accompanied
by twelve armed men, entered “La
Financière” building in quest of these
securities, which they had been informed,
through some unknown source, were preserved
there. The soldiers were posted
in all corridors to prevent any attempt to
escape the seizure by employés passing
from one office room to another—a trick
resorted to by others on more than one
occasion of perquisition! The general
manager, Mr. D. Heineman, an American,
was then called, and bidden by the officers
to submit his books and vaults for examination.
This he did without the least
hesitancy, having already—in anticipation
of such a visit—altered his books
and removed the securities to a vault,
in the same building, sufficiently camouflaged
to defy detection.</p>

<p>When the officers failed to find any trace
of the desired deposits they expressed
surprise, and affirmed they had learned,
on good authority, such securities were
held by the house. Mr. Heineman replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the information was quite correct, but, as
could be seen by his books, the securities
had been removed from Belgium at a
certain prior date.</p>

<p>Meanwhile dishonesty increased in the
lower ranks. Even those employed in the
food organization filched sugar, rice, flour,
etc., which they sold secretly at enormous
prices. Certain personal experiences may
illustrate the crafty ingenuity which prolonged
sorrow and deprivation gradually
developed among the common people—occasionally,
too, among those of the better
class, obliged for the first time in their
lives to suffer the degrading pangs of want.</p>

<p>Fruit, although there was plenty in the
country, was shipped away in such quantities
that the inhabitants could only indulge
in it as an expensive luxury. One
day, when I discovered a pushcart piled
high with nice-looking apples, at a price far
lower than that demanded at the market,
I ordered five kilos to be taken home and
paid for on delivery. The youth who,
with his mother, tended the cart agreed
to deliver them if his tram fare were paid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
in advance. As he had some distance to
go, this was willingly done, and a written
line given him for our butler, bidding him
pay for the fruit at the stated price. I then
went on to visit a friend, who, on learning
of the apples, immediately wanted some
and we set forth to revisit the cart.</p>

<p>We had, however, gone only a few yards,
when I was astonished to see the pushcart,
attended by both the youth and
his mother, standing before a house a few
doors below that of my friend, where they
were selling fruit.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” I asked the
youth. “You have not taken the apples
to my house!”</p>

<p>The young rascal, who had counted on
never seeing me again, hung his head, and
murmured with seeming penitence, “Ah,
I beg your pardon, but it was so far to go,
and I could not leave my poor mother to
push the cart alone.”</p>

<p>Although the best of the apples were now
sold—for all save those on top were miserable
things—we each ordered five kilos of
the fruit to be delivered at my friend’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
house. To obviate any more trickery
we remained by the cart while this was
done, and only paid after seeing the apples
taken in by a servant; then went on to
enjoy an unusually lovely afternoon in
the Bois, sure of having made a good
enough bargain, even though the fruit
secured was only fit for cooking.</p>

<p>But my friend, on returning home an
hour or so later, discovered we had been
worsted after all!</p>

<p>After waiting until we were out of sight,
the fruit-sellers went back to the house,
and, presenting the pencilled line I had
given and failed to reclaim, stated that we
had decided to purchase all the remaining
apples, at the price mentioned in the note.
Consequently, twenty odd kilos of remnant
fruit, such as no one else would buy,
were landed at my friend’s house at a
price more than double their worth!</p>

<p>On another occasion, when butter was
unprocurable even at thirty francs a kilo,
two peasant-women came to our house
with butter smuggled in from the country,
which they offered at twenty francs a kilo.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Eager as we were for it, but made cautious
by experience, we insisted upon tasting
before buying. The women readily
opened one package, and, on finding it excellent,
we agreed to take all they had—five
kilos; but, to prevent possible deception,
we sampled each package, all of
which were equally good. We therefore
joyously paid the price, and, after contracting
for more butter, and a quantity
of eggs to be delivered the following week,
dismissed the women with our blessings
and sincere gratitude.</p>

<p>But, alackaday! when those glorious
loaves of yellow butter were being prepared
an hour later for preservation, they
were discovered to be merely masses of
filthy fat surrounding a large <i>betterave</i>,
which made up the weight, the whole
cleverly covered with a thin layer of
good butter. Needless to say, the women
never returned, and as it was strictly forbidden
to buy peddled butter, we could
do nothing but grin and bear it.</p>

<p>These fraudulent geniuses were products
of the war, and no one who witnessed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
pain they bravely endured, for three years
and more, can justly condemn them.</p>

<p>And it was not only the poor who were
driven to desperation by the enemy’s
robbery. Everyone, save the very rich,
or the <i>Barons Zeep</i>—the so-called soap-barons
who made fortunes in secret relation
with the Germans—was reduced
to hard straits. Clothing became impossible
to procure. Fashionable women
were obliged to dye their linen sheets for
summer wear, their blankets and curtains
for winter; while club-men, in shiny
trousers and frayed cuffs, were wont to
exchange laughing comparisons as to the
condition of their other wearing apparel,
one likening his oft-patched pyjamas to
Jacob’s coat of many colours!</p>

<p>A pathetic instance of this dire need
came to my notice one day as I was trying
to coax a farmer in the open fields
to sell me potatoes—for there was no
other means of obtaining this article of
food save by buying surreptitiously,
smuggling it home under cover of night,
and burying it underground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>While I was talking to the farmer, an
elderly man slowly passed us—a man
evidently of good birth, whose clothes,
though worn and shabby, showed the
cut of a good tailor. Soon after he had
passed, the farmer abruptly checked what
he was saying to me and, with sullen
eyes directed toward another part of his
acres, muttered, “Look at that! They
are all thieves, even the aristocrats!”</p>

<p>I looked, and saw the man referred to
tugging frantically to uproot a <i>carrot</i>!</p>

<p>The farmer uttered a loud and angry
cry, which interrupted his efforts. He
rose without haste, and moved slowly
away, his stick held dejectedly behind
him.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">AS may be seen, existence did not
improve with time. Each month
the situation became darker and more
alarming; and, after the United States
declared war, the few Americans, we
among them, obliged to remain in Brussels
were hated by the occupying powers
quite as cordially as the English. But
we who represented a nation not only
mighty in wealth and man-power, but of
vast commercial importance to Germany,
were treated with far greater consideration
than the Belgians. Nevertheless,
after the United States Minister, Consul,
and entire diplomatic corps departed, we
felt more or less at the mercy of that
bullying tendency which power always
brings out in the Prussian military
character.</p>

<p>The United States Consul, Mr. Ethelbert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Watts—a man known for his tactful
handling of difficult situations and trained
in diplomacy by many years of service
in the greater capitals—told me an instance
of this characteristic.</p>

<p>It was at the beginning of the third
year of war. Among the forlorn creatures
he took under his protection was a young
lad below military age, a Belgian on the
paternal side, whose mother, a widow
American-born, was then in the States.
The lad and his sister had been left in
Brussels to await her return, but as she
was unable to do so, the two were
soon reduced to deplorable straits. The
sister found a home through marriage,
but no other improvement of circumstances.
The boy was taken into the
consulate to assure him some means of
support, besides what the Consul personally
allowed him. But when the
Germans began to seize young civilians,
and send them to work in the trenches
or in Germany, the boy’s mother sent
heart-broken appeals to have her son,
delicate and wholly unfit for such labour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
shipped on to join her. Although this
appeared hopeless, the Consul, as representative
of a country still neutral, did
his best to accomplish it. After much
labour and long argument he succeeded;
the youth received a pass, and was ready
to leave on a certain date.</p>

<p>The evening before his departure for
Holland, the Consul received a hastily-scrawled
note from the lad, stating that
he had been arrested, and was then
locked up, he knew not why. It was too
late to do anything that evening, but the
following morning the Consul went to
German headquarters to obtain an explanation.</p>

<p>He was received by a stout, red-faced
superior officer, who at first refused to
answer questions, but finally announced
that the boy was suspected of espionage.</p>

<p>“May I ask upon what ground?” the
Consul demanded politely.</p>

<p>“Upon several suspicious indications,”
was the evasive reply; “he must be held
for further examination.”</p>

<p>“But his passage to America is booked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
for the day after to-morrow,” urged the
Consul. “He must leave Brussels to-day
if he is to catch the ship.”</p>

<p>The other shrugged, saying indifferently,
“I regret that is impossible.”</p>

<p>“But his pass has been given him,
sir, and as I have personally vouched
for his integrity, I consider it only fair
you should tell me on what ’suspicious
indications’ you hold him.”</p>

<p>After a lengthy and needless discussion,
it was asserted that the boy’s notebook
betrayed he had carried letters, and delivered
them to several persons in the
city.</p>

<p>At this Mr. Watts looked amazed.
“Certainly,” he retorted; “he was in my
employ for that purpose, and I can prove
to you that every letter he conveyed
related to legitimate consular business.”</p>

<p>After some more wrangling the notebook
was produced, and this proven to
be true, but the stubborn tyrant showed
no sign of yielding. The proof could not
be held as satisfactory until investigated.
And so forth and so forth, until, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
another half-hour of futile talk, the
officer suddenly announced that the boy
could on no condition be liberated without
the payment of a fine.</p>

<p>“It will be a matter of two thousand
francs or so,” he complacently added,
confident of adding this amount to sums
extorted daily from the inhabitants on
one pretence or another. “Of course, as
the boy has no means, payment may be
made by anyone who....”</p>

<p>There he was abruptly stopped, for the
American’s rage, already at boiling-point,
could no longer be controlled. Although
a less robust and considerably older man,
the Consul sprang aggressively to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Not one centime shall be paid!” he
cried, shaking a defiant finger under the
officer’s very nose; “and if that boy
is not liberated to-day, my Government
shall hear of the matter in every detail
by cable!”</p>

<p>His face was white, and the flame in
his eyes drove some red from the
Prussian’s face. The latter’s tactics immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
changed. “Come, come, sir;
no need to lose your temper,” he
remonstrated, in a voice now devoid of
its former dictatorial tone. “Let us talk
it over quietly; perhaps we may....”</p>

<p>“No,” interrupted the Consul. “I
have talked for over an hour, and have
said all I have to say. This is my last
word on the subject—good morning!”</p>

<p>As it was then luncheon-time, he returned
to his residence, scarcely hoping
for a satisfactory settlement of the matter,
but determined, should it be denied, to
carry out his threat.</p>

<p>This proved unnecessary, for, on going
to his office an hour or so later, he found
the boy there to greet him, and sent him
off to Holland that evening.</p>

<p>This incident serves to show the mental
attitude of the powers then dominating
Belgium, and also explains the consideration,
comparatively speaking, shown to
Americans. Belgium was at their mercy,
and, owing to sufferings inflicted, more or
less outwardly submissive, since those who
betrayed the least resistance were cast into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
prison with no hope of being avenged,
at any definite period, by their exiled
Government. It also demonstrates that
worst of all the evil qualities developed
by militarism in the German who wore
a uniform—the readiness to crush the
weak and to respect firm and fearless
defiance in the strong. This quality,
manifested even in peace-time—among the
police, for instance, and other officials in
Berlin—is peculiarly galling to foreigners.</p>

<p>In October 1917 another copper raid
took place, and our homes were again
subjected to armed invasion. We were
now ordered to deliver the beds we slept
on, if brass, our chandeliers, bathroom
fittings, and all ornamentation in brass
or copper with which our houses were
embellished—to dismount and convey
them to the enemy without a murmur.
This, after all kitchen-utensils and many
other necessaries had already been
claimed! And, strangest of all, while this
robbery of private houses was going on,
many shops in the city remained well
stocked with all manner of things, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
brass and copper, which, being new and
marketable, were left for a later seizure,
to be shipped to Germany for sale!</p>

<p>Machinery of all sorts was also taken;
the before-mentioned steel manufacturer
of Bruges told me how he was robbed of
a vast and very valuable plant, of which
some important portions had been purchased
in Germany just before the war.
Military engineers came to look over the
place, noted down the more valuable
fittings, and informed him that men
would come to dismount them the following
day. They arrived as predicted,
and their chief was the very man originally
sent to set them up by the German
firm who had sold our friend the machines!
A week or two later another representative
of this same firm had the audacity
to present himself before the ruined manufacturer
and try to negotiate with him
for the purchase of new machinery after
the war!</p>

<p>It may be the recognized right of an
occupying army to demand what it
urgently needs and cannot otherwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
procure, but in Belgium there was no
question of right or need; everything
was taken, not only copper and
machinery, but silverware, clothing, and
articles of artistic worth, which could be
of no possible use to the army; and,
from Bruges and other places, many
priceless paintings, and other treasures
of artistic and historical value.</p>

<p>An explanation of this latter feature
of the general and systematic looting
was given rather dramatically by one of
the German soldiers engaged in rifling
a house. It was witnessed by a friend of
mine. The house adjoined that of my
friend, and he, expecting his turn would
come next, watched to learn what he
must hide while all sorts of metal objects
were brought forth and hurled into a
van waiting to receive them.</p>

<p>Presently one of the soldiers, acting according
to orders, came out bearing a silver
tray, on which was an exquisite tea-set of
the same metal. He carried it with care
toward the van, paused, and examined
it pensively. Then, after brief deliberation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
he set it down on the pavement, took
two of the shining objects, a teapot and
cream-jug, and savagely beat them
together until no vestige of their fair
form remained. After throwing these
into the van, he did the same by the
others, and finally trod on the tray,
destroying it with his heavy, iron-nailed
boots. A second soldier, coming laden
from the house, paused to watch him in
amazement.</p>

<p>“What are you doing that for?” he
asked.</p>

<p>The other, taking up the mutilated
tray, glanced at him with flaming eyes.</p>

<p>“There’s no need for the officers to
have these pretty things!” he growled,
and tossed it into the van.</p>

<p>Another man, Monsieur de R., told me
the following interesting experience:</p>

<p>His country house, stocked with things
of beauty and value, accumulated during
many years of travel, was occupied and
pillaged when the German army, drunk
with the temporary success of their first
onslaught, were pursuing bandit methods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
through the country. Everything was
taken: pictures and other almost priceless
works of art, silver, glass-ware, even
linen and clothing. What could not be
removed was cut through with swords
or otherwise destroyed, and the château,
after sheltering troops for some time, left
in a deplorable state of wreckage and
filth. The park was damaged by horses,
and many of the fine old trees cut down
for firewood. Monsieur de R. bore the
loss with that amazing stoic endurance
manifested throughout by the Belgians.
His only remark at the time was: “It
is sad; but—<i>que voulez-vous</i>? We are at
their mercy, and they have neither mercy
nor conscience!”</p>

<p>But that all Germans are not devoid of
these qualities, he had, a few weeks later
rather astounding proof.</p>

<p>One day the card of a lady whom he did
not know was presented to him at his
Brussels residence, accompanied by a request
to speak with him privately upon an
urgent matter. As the name was German,
he hesitated; but curiosity impelled him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to receive the mysterious visitor. She
proved to be a young and refined woman,
very shy, and evidently greatly agitated.</p>

<p>After returning his cold bow she came to
the point at once: “I have come to tell you,
Monsieur, that many of the things taken
from your château were sent on to me in
Germany.”</p>

<p>“<i>Vraiment?</i>” he replied, with a
scarcely perceptible smile of ironic
wonderment.</p>

<p>“Yes; they were sent to me by my
fiancé, the officer who—obtained them
from your house.” Her lips trembled as
she sought for a less objectionable word
than “stole” to express the deed. “I am
having them all returned to you—every
item. They have not even been unpacked.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” The Belgian stared, unable
to imagine the object of this astounding
statement from one of a race he believed
devoid of honour.</p>

<p>But, without a word of encouragement,
the noble girl related her story in a brave
but unsteady voice, broken, toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
end, by tears that did much to soften his
bitter feelings. The objects referred to,
carefully packed in cases, had reached
her after a letter from her fiancé relating
how he had procured them. How he put
it, she did not reveal; but her reply was a
determined and high-spirited refusal to
accept them. She had come to Brussels
in order personally to see the victim of
this robbery, and obtain his word of
honour that he would never divulge her
fiancé’s name in connection with the
affair.</p>

<p>My friend was so greatly impressed and
touched by the admirable courage and
fineness of her confession, that he readily
gave the promise, and I believe no power
could force him to break it!</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">THE Belgian race, in general, is
possessed of a certain philosophic
patience under calamity, engendered, no
doubt, by the fact that their country has
so often served as the battlefield of other
nations. Though hating their oppressors,
they seldom, even in private, uttered any
emphatic expression of hatred; and such
criticism as was spoken was characterized
by admirable, sometimes amazing fairness.</p>

<p>Even at the darkest times I have often
heard persons of all classes express
generous acknowledgment of the slightest
evidence of justice on the part of the
Government, and have been impressed,
when wrongful acts were related, by their
failing to omit the least redeeming detail
they considered essential to truth.</p>

<p>By the time the second demand for
copper was made, the people were too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
hopelessly miserable to express resentment
even in private. Words had proven
too futile, and active revolt would have
been folly. But, unreviling as they were,
and morally stunned by knowledge of
their helplessness, they stored up their
wrongs in their memories and aching
hearts. At this period, too, the subtle
German scheme for exciting the Flemish
population against the Walloons, thus
causing internal discord, had reached a
critical point. The few Flemings who
ignorantly allowed themselves to be
bought or persuaded to help this plot, and
so secure a commercial market in Belgium
after the war, occasionally, at the enemy’s
dictation, made demonstrations usually
ending in riots. Thus among the people
an enmity was stirred up, likely to prove
more serious after the war.</p>

<p>When, after the second glorious check
before Paris, the German forces were being
driven back for the last time, the official
attitude in Brussels became considerably
milder. The miserable news-sheets allowed
us wailed sycophantic appeals to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the world’s “humanity” to stem the
“deluge of blood” flowing from the flood-gates
opened by Germany herself. And
yet, at the same time, the controlling
Powers left no means untried to excite
civil war in Belgium. Side by side with
these touching and flowery appeals to an
outraged world, were long columns pointing
out how the Flemish population had
been wronged for generations; calling
them to stand up for their rights; subtly
suggesting how, with Germany at their
back, they could be masters of the
country! The brother of my dentist, a
Fleming, was approached, and asked to
head a certain association aiming at Flemish
dominance. He was promised not only
all the coal, potatoes, and other necessities
he needed, but also that a hundred
thousand francs would be deposited to his
credit in a Dutch bank. To his honour,
it may be added, he refused the offer with
scorn, as did all those of intelligence whom
the enemy tried to seduce.</p>

<p>With such shameful wrongs eating into
their souls, these people were expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
again to dismantle their homes, and help
Germany to hold territory won by craft,
while seeking an advantageous peace.
No step back would the invaders take
to spare millions of poor citizens driven
daily from hearth and home. On the
contrary, they hunted them forth like
cattle, at the evacuation of each town, in
order to loot their houses and shops. The
sister of our cook and her husband were
driven from Menin without being allowed
time to safeguard their possessions.
Scarcely had they issued from their abode,
where, after years of effort, they had established
a small business in clocks and jewellery,
when a German van appeared at
their door, and, in their very sight, carried
away over five thousand francs-worth
of hard-earned stock. The couple, with
hundreds of others, were herded into a
cattle-car so closely that they were obliged
to stand, pressed one against another.
They were carried on to a town near Ghent,
and thence made to walk for four hours,
in the night, and without food; crowded
into another cattle-car, and distributed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
destitute, over the country to subsist, as
best they could, on the charity of others.</p>

<p>One Belgian told me the following story
without a quiver of voice or other show
of feeling, save that the pain of it drove
the colour from his face. He possessed
a château at Aerschot and, having married
during the war, was allowed to return
to it with his bride during the second
summer. He found the place greatly
altered, for it had been occupied by
German troops, and much damage had
been done, especially in the park, where
trees planted by his grandfathers had been
ruthlessly felled. But sadder than all,
he said, was the fact that many familiar
faces had disappeared from the adjacent
village. On making inquiries, he learned
that all those missing had been shot as
innocent examples in order to impress
others with terror of German “frightfulness.”
Though told this by the remaining
villagers he could hardly believe it; for
among the absent were old men, a priest,
and one young boy whose mother had
since died of a broken heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>But during the heat of summer he had
a ghastly proof that the accounts were
true. At a certain point near his park
he noticed an appalling odour. After
tracing it to a low mound, he had the place
opened, and there discovered sixty of the
absent villagers, shot, and buried in a heap,
scarcely more than a foot under ground.</p>

<p>Another man told me as calmly of an
incident that occurred near his country-seat,
at the home of a farmer he knew.
The farmer had a number of Prussian
officers and soldiers billeted upon him in
1914 and, being both good-natured and
prudent, he treated them well. When
the day came for them to depart, the chief
officers, three in number, bade him harness
the one horse he still possessed, and
drive them to Brussels. There they were
to remain a day before rejoining their
troops, which were to depart on foot
that afternoon. The farmer’s wife and
daughter, after serving the officers with
breakfast, took leave of them amiably
enough, and received their thanks for
courteous treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>But on returning alone, at twilight of
the same day, the farmer was surprised
to see no smoke coming from his chimney,
and still more astonished to find the doors
wide open and bits of broken crockery
strewn about the courtyard. Before
taking his horse to the stable, he cried
loudly for his wife, and receiving no
answer, ran into the house, which he found
deserted. Neither wife nor daughter were
there to welcome him, and the kitchen
presented a scene of strange disorder, as
though wild beasts had been in battle
there. Broken dishes lay on the floor,
empty wine bottles and tumblers stood
on the table, and one lay under it in the
midst of a dark, dry stain of wine. To
make a long story short, the farmer
rushed in terror to the village and there
found his assistant surrounded by a group
of terrified townsfolk, discussing the
tragedy.</p>

<p>No sooner had the farmer departed,
than soldiers entered his house, raided
the wine-cellar and, after drinking themselves
into beasts, assaulted his wife and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
daughter. The assistant had attempted
to defend them, but being unequal to the
task against so many, ran to the village
for help. When he returned with others it
was too late; they found the farm vacated;
wife, daughter, and soldiers gone!</p>

<p>The farmer, half-maddened with fear on
hearing this, set out with a number of
others to search for his dear ones; but
only after nightfall they found a trace
of them, in a wood some distance from
the farm.</p>

<p>While following with lanterns the foot-marks
of soldiers which led them to this
spot, the farmer suddenly espied a bit of
the gown his daughter had worn, protruding
from the ground. The place was
opened, and there, just beneath the sod,
lay the body of his daughter in the
ghastly pose of hurried burial.</p>

<p>Later his wife was discovered, quite
demented, roaming far off in the country.</p>

<p>This story is not given as one of the
most atrocious of those we heard almost
daily; for it is far from that. In this
case the criminals were drunken soldiers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
not cold-blooded, sober officers, such as
the authors of the Aerschot tragedy,
those committed at Tamines, and all
along the route from Liège to Brussels!</p>

<p>Many of the stories were so unspeakably
horrible I should not care to perpetuate
them in print. I have, moreover,
limited myself to such events as came
to me first-hand, and also to avoid those
already known. These two are recounted
merely to demonstrate the lack of human
understanding evinced by the German
authorities, who expected a people so
treated submissively to yield up their
possessions, even their very beds and
mattresses, to an enemy that had scorned
all principles of right and shown them no
slightest hint of mercy.</p>

<p>It was little to be wondered at that
they hid or destroyed their goods rather
than yield them, even though obliged to
endure severe punishment when discovered.
And no less comprehensible was
their contempt for the peace-whines,—the
subtle endeavours of a defeated bully
to avert the punishment every heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
in Belgium was eager should overtake
them.</p>

<p>The stupidity of Prussian rule in
Belgium was only equalled by this childish
effort to escape the consequences of
their stupendous crime!—an effort scorned,
not only by the Belgians, but by every
neutral who had seen with what appalling
contempt for all laws of humanity, justice,
and civilization they had misused their
power, when victory had seemed likely to
be theirs.</p>

<p>Long before the too-patient United
States raised an avenging hand, several
of her children were arrested in Brussels
for bitter utterances they could not control.
I remember how a young fellow
who, having diplomatic connections, had
long suppressed his ire, let out one day
when he and some friends were lunching
together in a café. It was at the time
when Belgian civilians were being taken
by force to work for the enemy, and one
of the party had related a heart-breaking
scene witnessed at one of the railroad
stations. Mothers, wives, and sisters were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
gathered there, weeping and shrieking
against the unpardonable cruelty.</p>

<p>This pitiable tale, and others quite as
distressing, had roused them all; but
the young fellow referred to was beside
himself, and when others endeavoured to
quiet him, he sprang up and rushed into
the street. One or two followed, fearing
what he might do, and saw him deliberately
cross to the centre of a public square,
where, standing bare-headed, he shouted
at the top of his voice: “To hell with
the Kaiser! To hell with the Kaiser!”</p>

<p>Had he not been dragged back to the
café by his companions, he probably
would have continued his perilous insult
until brought into the desired contact
with some German. But such brief satisfaction
would have caused not only distress
to his entire family, but probably
more wide-spreading difficulties. Another
American was arrested and dragged to
the Kommandantur for having been rude
to a soldier in the street, and several were
in the German black-book for betraying
inimical feelings more or less openly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time later, when the Teuton
spirit was considerably broken, a young
American accidentally trod on a soldier’s
foot while boarding a tram and, being
insulted, answered back, to be at once
arrested by a spy who stood near.
When brought to trial, guarded by armed
men, before three officers with revolvers
in their belts, he was ordered to stand
straight, to take his hands from his
pockets and show the respect that German
officers demanded. He was, in fact,
goaded and bullied in order to force him
to a show of temper for which a larger
fine could be imposed upon him!</p>

<p>The country’s distress was greatly augmented
when hundreds of homes, already
darkened by bereavement and want,
echoed the wailing of women robbed of
those dear to them under particularly
painful circumstances. For every man,
young or old, of those taken to Germany
solemnly swore, before departing, that he
would die of starvation rather than do a
stroke of work for the hated enemy. All
refused, also, to sign statements (into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
which the Germans endeavoured to trick
them) declaring they left their country
willingly!</p>

<p>But they were dragged off, crowded
into cattle cars, side-tracked, and left
to wait without warmth or food until the
military authorities saw fit to let their
train pass on. What those men suffered
has been recounted by those who investigated
these cruelties. I can only judge
by the few instances I saw myself. The
unspeakable horror of these will never
leave me. Several lads came back to die,
with hands and feet frozen, too far gone
even to take hot milk with which one
sought to coax them back to life. The
butcher’s boy, also, who delivered our
meat, returned maimed for life owing to
the freezing of his feet.</p>

<p>These, like most others, had refused
to help their country’s destroyers, and
were consequently starved and subjected
to all manner of ill-treatment. When
reduced to the last atom of vitality they
were shipped back like beasts—with less
care, indeed, than beasts—locked into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
bitterly cold cars where the conditions
became vile, since they were not allowed
to leave them for a moment during the
long, slow, oft-impeded journey. Many,
it is stated, died on the way back, and a
number of those who survived, after careful
feeding with spoonfuls of hot milk,
were cripples for life.</p>

<p>Much later, when life here became intolerable
for these poor wretches and hope
of deliverance had died in them, I believe
that some of the weaker ones did go
willingly to do <i>harvest</i> work in Germany.
At the time referred to, however, all
intended to work for the army refused
as one man, and were taken by brute
force.</p>

<p>But the German people were told that
these men were carried off because they
were starving at home! One of the most
outrageous deeds in a whole list of evils
was represented as an act of charity!</p>

<p>It is this trickery, this systematic lying,
which, from the war’s very beginning, has
stained the Prussian standard and will
always stain it in the eyes of posterity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Their war has been one, unfortunately,
in which the shameful deeds of their
leaders must always overshadow the courage
of their troops. Acts of severity, even
crimes, when committed for a vital and
otherwise unattainable object, if daringly
and humanely done, command a certain
amount of respect. But the Prussian
tactics were neither daring, merciful, nor
wise. Always some excuse, stupid and
transparent, was offered, and never, under
any circumstances, was tact exercised.
Had those unhappy Belgians been well
treated on their out-going journey (some
even said the soldiers spat in their coffee,
the only nourishment they received, after
twelve hours locked up in the cars!),
had they been cared for even as cattle
<i>must</i> be, how much more likely would they
have yielded to the demands of their
persecutors!</p>

<p>Deceit, clumsiness, and obvious delight
in giving pain were the principal elements
of the German occupation; self-evident
trickery like the trumped-up delegation
of Flemings sent to Berlin; the hurling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
of shrapnel into the city of Brussels, and
attributing it to the Allies! As the
Germans photographed waving handkerchiefs
at windows in Brussels when
some Prussian of consequence visited the
city, in order to impress Germany with
the pro-German sentiment of a Belgia in
love with her ravagers!</p>

<p>I have often wondered, had England
been the invader and tactful Britons—such
as those who won the confidence
even of the Boers and of all the Indian
tribes—had been the masters of Belgium,
what would have been their influence,
in the end, upon a people weary
of suffering, whose original faith in ultimate
triumph was being extinguished
month by month. Many might have
been won by kindness even from the hand
that had smitten them; indeed, had the
enemy thereafter shown them even ordinary
consideration, it is rather terrible to
think what the consequence might have
been during a period of subjection far
longer than the least sanguine could have
anticipated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>In November 1917 news of the Italian
disaster, grossly exaggerated, was published
in three languages on all the city
walls, with galling comments and childish
boasts. Attention was called to the fact
that the Central Powers had won from
Italy, in three days, all that she had
acquired in two years, and so forth. No
chance was lost to dishearten the Belgian
people, though, considering their absolutely
helpless condition, the object of
this is hard to imagine. It can only be
understood as the same shortsighted
and unnecessary bullying which a British
soldier later told me he had endured for
seven months when a prisoner in Germany.
This poor fellow, a New Zealander, who
had volunteered “for Belgium’s sake”—one
of the many half-starved and filthy
heroes who swarmed to Brussels when
freed of their chains—recounted horrors
of his prison existence almost beyond
belief. Besides being obliged to work for
the military advantage of their enemies,
they were crowded together in such
numbers that to sit down in their place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
of confinement was impossible; and when
sleeping at night, they were obliged to lie
one on top of the other. The heat and
vermin were so intolerable, that a large
percentage of them died, and all were
forced to discard their clothing, in order
to fight lice that swarmed over them “like
a grey covering of dust”! But into
those ghastly details I have no heart to
go. I only refer to this one of innumerable
stories, because of a feature that
illustrates the ignoble and needless bullying
practised by the Prussian officials.
This man stated that their presiding
officer not only obliged them to salute
him with the utmost humility, but made
them wait upon him as slaves. He would
deliberately drop his pencil to the ground
several times, and order a British soldier
to return it each time with a subservient
obeisance!</p>

<p>In the midst of the discouragement
caused by the news from Italy, the new
copper raid took place, and an <i>avis</i>
appeared requisitioning all dogs above
forty centimetres in height. This <i>affiche</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
appeared soon after a tax of forty francs
on every dog had been announced—a
tax resisted by the Belgian police, who
refused to supply the authorities with
information as to dog owners. It was
said, and the bicycle affair gave weight
to the supposition, that the demand
for dogs was merely a preliminary to
exacting the tax. At any rate, the
requisition was either vengeance for opposition,
or a means of learning who had
dogs; for the matter eventually died out,
after causing a panic of grief and the
painless slaughtering of many pets, in
order to save them from ill-treatment by
the army. I went to a vet. for this
purpose, and there saw a man of middle
age openly weeping, and with him his
one remaining home companion—since his
wife was dead, and a son lost in battle—a
soft-eyed, beautiful Groenendael. Even
in the streets women were sobbing, and
what occurred in the houses where dogs
were cherished, I can only imagine by the
distress reigning in ours.</p>

<p>Some time later, another <i>affiche</i> announced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
that only dogs under four years
old would be taken—a correction which
came too late, for many hundreds of
persons had already sacrificed their
animals. But dogs too old for training
would only have been an encumbrance
to the army; so, after many worthless
dogs had been given up, for a small payment,
by those who stole or secured them
in other ways, this amendment, which
would have spared many a heartache,
was tardily published.</p>

<p>Our dogs we never declared, and kept
in hiding until the matter gradually died
down; and so saved them, after many
weeks of anxiety and fear, although
hundreds were taken day by day. There
was some mystery about the whole affair.
It can only be explained as another mean
scheme for obtaining money, whose failure
evoked this method of vengeance, for
there was abundance of dogs to be had
for army work, without depriving people
of their pets.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">NINETEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN dawned with little
suggestion of the brilliant and victorious
events it had in store for us. Belgium
was at the end of her strength, almost
at the end of her courage. Everyone,
even the wealthy, was cold for lack of
fuel in the midst of an unusually severe
winter; many were starving, and no
one had <i>enough</i> to eat. There was, also,
scarcely any gas to relieve the darkness
of early dusk; in some quarters of Brussels
no gas at all, and no candles to be had.
The weather was abnormally bitter, and
winter dragged on relentlessly into the
month of March—the <span class="smcap">Black Month</span>, when
even the bravest hearts were ready to
break under the harrowing news of that
second German offensive, rushing forward
again over all the hard-gained territory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
across which we had with such eagerness
and confidence followed the Allies on the
map!</p>

<p>Nothing can depict the moral anguish
of those days in Brussels, when the
German <i>affiches</i> were announcing victory
after victory—when an increase of force,
gathered from the Russian front, made
their success appear inevitable. Trainloads
of cannon, ammunition, and men
rolled by during whole days and nights,
troops reinforced by the desperate determination
to win, by foul means or fair,
which obsessed the Kaiser and his chiefs.
It was a time of utter despair for the
Belgians—for everyone, indeed, whose
sympathies were with the Allies. And,
to add to the pervading misery, every
German victory was not only blazoned
on the walls, but troops were marched
through the city playing joyous and
triumphant music from early morning
until evening!</p>

<p>When, at last, the news reached us
that their onrush was stemmed for the
second time, the occupying powers concealed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
it from us as far as possible. We
had looked for great things from America,
but were told that their men could not
get over, while our souls were sickened
by eulogistic accounts of all that the
under-sea boats were doing. Each edition
of our miserable papers presented a long
list of ships sent to the bottom by treacherous
Germany.</p>

<p>But the Zeppelin was dead! That was
some comfort; and, with a feeling that
it was perhaps the sign of better times,
we saw demolished the enormous iron-clad
garage where one of these monsters
used to be housed.</p>

<p>But few gleams of real promise reached
us, and it was dread of a fifth winter,
then appearing inevitable, that broke
the spirit of those who went (only then)
to work in Germany as a desperate act
of self-preservation.</p>

<p>Even in days that were so much
brighter for outsiders, in August and
September, we were denied the satisfaction
of knowing that our cause was
progressing. The information allowed us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
did little to ease the pressure of mingled
hope and anxiety. We longed to learn
something definitely encouraging of what
was going on where the cannon, ever
louder, was continuously roaring. Day
by day our papers were searched for
some hopeful news, through long columns
concocted only to destroy hope and breed
despair. Every event suggesting menace
to the Allied countries, culled from obscure
journals in every part of the world (especially
from the <i>National Zeitung</i> of Bâle),
was set forth and embroidered. Often
they bore no more reliable heading than
“<i>Le Bruit court</i>,” but their effect on a
people now morbidly prone to look on
the dark side of things was none the less
depressing. Irish troubles; strikes and
discontent in India; political confusion
in France and Italy; friction between
the United States and Japan or Mexico;
disastrous failure of the Allied venture
in Russia—such items contrasted with
the triumphant German communiqués,
which, even when acknowledging retreat,
depicted it as a victory, or a mere tactical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
movement to attain a stronger position for
a decisive counter offensive.</p>

<p>Only later were we allowed to know
when a position of importance was won
by the Allies. Our first knowledge that
Péronne had been retaken was the naïve
announcement in the German report,
“Péronne now finds itself immediately
in front of our lines”!—as though the
town had grown weary of being behind
them, and had of its own will altered its
position!</p>

<p>On Monday, 30th September, our principal
source of news, <i>La Belgique</i> (entirely
under German control), contained
the following: “Between the Ailette
and the Aisne there have been no more
battles, but the Germans have withdrawn
their line to the east of section
Allemont-Jany, leaving Pirnon, Chavegnor,
and the fort of La Malmaison
in the hands of the French.” In regard
to the retreat at Cambrai it was stated
in the same paper, 30th September, that
the withdrawal “<i>plus en arrière</i>” of
German troops was executed at night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
unperceived by the enemy, who “for a
long time the following morning still
held the evacuated territory under fire”;
and, in reference to the situation between
the Ailette and the Aisne, “Without the
least intervention of the enemy, we have
drawn back our line behind the Canal de
l’Oise,” etc. “<i>Ce mouvement, préparé
depuis de jours, s’est effectué méthodiquement
et sans être entravé par l’ennemi.</i>”
This “official report,” in a tone of curt
indifference, proceeds to show all British
advances as negligible. Then came such
an announcement as this: “Conflict
between Suippes and the Aisne and also
between Argonne and the Meuse; our
forces have attained a complete success.”</p>

<p>The redemption of Cambrai, St.
Quentin, etc., we only discovered after
tracing on the map insignificant places
appearing in the war-news allowed us as
reached or passed by the Allied forces;
usually farms or other trifling localities
formerly unknown to fame. Delightful
as these discoveries were, they could
awake no thrill of confident enthusiasm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
because overshadowed by the contemptuous
tone in which each slight
advance and the appalling cost to French
and English was presented. Moreover,
every Allied success was attributed solely
to the clever military strategy of the
Germans. Above all was belittled any
progress made by the British, whose
abridged and doctored communiqués were
always presented in weak and childlike
terms that made them appear ridiculous.
The English never knew, until several
days after evacuation, that the Germans
had withdrawn from any locality for
which they were fighting. It was stated
in an official announcement from Berlin,
dated 8th September: “<i>Le détachement
du contact avec l’ennemi s’operait
presque toujours à l’insu de l’ennemi.</i>”
Another official statement (13th August)
was as follows: “The British offensive
between the Ancre and the Avre has been
checked, after the strong and vain attacks
which have cost them such great losses,
at the limit of the old battlefield of the
Somme.... On the other hand, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
French have once more placed in line
many fresh divisions in order to attempt
to pierce, in spite of all, our positions
between the Avre and the Oise to which
the Germans have retired in so able a
manner (<i>d’une manière si habile</i>) after
having inflicted such heavy losses on
their adversaries.”</p>

<p>Niggardly as this information was, we
were of course able to derive from it a
certain amount of encouragement. But
this was damped by the boastful German
confidence, the constantly reiterated
threat of another vast offensive which
would bring the war to an end glorious
for Germany; the awful descriptions of
French towns reduced to heaps of ashes,
and the incalculable losses of the Allies.</p>

<p>In September, when matters were much
harder than we suspected for the Central
Powers, a new voice came from the
monster’s mouth—or rather a still more
pitiful, soft-hearted cry for poor suffering
humanity!—from these people who, after
two thousand years of civilization that
had gained for them so high a place in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the world, had revived, without cause,
the treachery and barbarity that had
made them odious to and distrusted by
Cæsar; who committed crimes in 1914-15
and 1916 that will haunt the world’s
memory for ever! What a mockery must
those German pleas for humanity have
appeared to the people of Tamines, Aerschot,
Louvain, and other districts of
Belgium still grieving for those ruthlessly
murdered, still morally suffering from the
horrors to which they were unjustly subjected!</p>

<p>Heart-rending pictures were given of
fair towns destroyed in the valley of the
Somme; of their homeless and perishing
inhabitants; of beautiful historic edifices
wrecked by the “folly of the French bombarding
their own cities”—those centres
of a hostile Power that had not hesitated
to commit any outrage in its vainglorious
and frantic rush for Paris! No murmur
of regret had escaped the success-intoxicated
legions who advanced, with comparative
ease, from the ruins of innocent
Belgian towns, leaving devastation and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
despair behind them! No pang of remorse
then made them hesitate to slaughter
guiltless citizens, and bury them in heaps,
sometimes before life was extinct, or to
crucify their first British prisoners—a fact
I was later assured was true, by an English
soldier who had seen the bodies!</p>

<p>But now that the avenging armies, overcoming
obstacles such as the Germans
never had to face, were uprooting them
from the strongholds prepared during four
years, the despotic song of victory through
frightfulness suddenly became a whine of
compassion, a childish and stupid wail
for peace! No outsider could have been
more infuriated at this than those in
Brussels who had suffered under the despot’s
hand and witnessed the vileness of
his deeds. Again and again long articles
appeared in our papers, trying to induce
the cold and famished Belgians to add
their impotent appeal for a cessation of
hostilities, and to impress them with the
suddenly developed Christian spirit of
Germany! This failing, an attempt was
made at terrorization. Photographs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
ruined towns in France were exhibited,
showing the homeless inhabitants flying
for their lives. The papers gave highly
coloured accounts of the general destruction,
misery, and horror on the scene of
each battle, as the price of every step in
advance made by the Allies. The same
fate was predicted for Belgium, should
the unlikely happen, and the invincible
German forces find it expedient to retire
to one of their many well-prepared strongholds
in that country. (The prospect of
a German defeat was represented as too
improbable to deserve contemplation.)
At one time an account appeared describing
the inevitable destruction of Brussels,
should the Germans ever be driven back
on it. In such a case, it was stated
officially, Brussels was to be “the bouquet
of the whole war.” Added to all this,
quotations equally disheartening were
printed from English papers. One, purporting
to be from <i>The New Statesman</i>, was
given on 2nd October as follows: “The
Germans will certainly draw back their
front to rectify it. But at a very short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
distance behind, they possess lines that
form a solid base and, if able to hold it,
they will not have lost more territory than
they occupied at the beginning of 1918.
And even supposing Douai and Cambrai
should be lost to them, the experience
of years must guard us against exaggerated
optimism.” “Above all,” it finishes,
“one can reasonably affirm that Hindenburg
and Ludendorf have not absolutely
renounced the idea of a counter offensive.
For the moment, they relinquish territory,
but their retreat is methodic, and we
should greatly deceive ourselves to imagine
it excludes the possibility of their launching
a vigorous counter attack, when the Anglo-French
assault will have come to an end
through exhaustion.” With such discouraging
signs came the German movement
for peace and plea for humanity!</p>

<p>“This war-fury, this rage for destruction,
must be nailed to the pillory” was
quoted, about the same time, from a
German socialistic paper of 1st August
1918. Would it have been quoted four
years earlier, when blood and destruction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
were the means by which Germany
thought to crush civilized states and
become master of Europe? Now that her
war-chariot lay wrecked amid the corpses
of her legions, death, slaughter, and devastation
suddenly began to appal her,
and roused a cry of fear which found no
echo in Belgium. When the British announced
they were fighting east of Roussoy
and had occupied Lempire, the official
information from Berlin, dated the 20th
September, told us “the British attempted
an advance in the sector Epehy-Lempire
with a great number of tanks. An
enormous number of these were destroyed,
the remainder being obliged to retire;
and as to the British infantry, they fled
in haste toward their positions of departure.”
Every effort of the Allies was
depicted as having failed, “<i>grâce au feu
des mitrailleuses et de l’infanterie allemandes</i>.”
Then, at the tail-end, a brief
announcement would appear that the
German line had retired, for strategical
reasons, without being molested by the
enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to these confusing and
contradictory reports long editorials
appeared sneering at the Allies’ futile
efforts. The Americans’ advance at
St. Mihiel was presented as having been
attained “without combat,” the Germans
having drawn back in accordance with
long-prepared plans, and so secretly that
the enemy was not aware of it and “only
pursued us very hesitatingly.” When
the British made their great rush on
Cambrai and broke through the line that
Hindenburg considered impregnable, it
was attributed to a fog. When they
advanced on Hummel it was over ground
that had been deliberately evacuated,
with such “masterly ability” that the
British for <i>two days</i> were unaware of the
German’s retirement!</p>

<p>Despite the irritation such accounts
caused in Brussels, enough was unintentionally
betrayed to revive our hope.
Most childish of all was the continued
boasting of what Germany had accomplished
in her first onrush, which, considering
all the overwhelming advantages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
she had, should have carried her to rapid
victory. With her check at the Marne
she was beaten, and that was the moment
when the people and troops of Germany
should have waked to their blunder, and
rid their great nation of a malady that
has ruined its prosperity and degraded its
name.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">AS the chances of war continued
adverse to the Kaiser’s “victorious
armies” the occupying government
began to show more lenient
tendencies. In high quarters a gradual
and very subtle softening was dimly
perceptible. Belgians guilty of patriotic
deeds that formerly would have brought
upon them the severest punishment—deeds
far more serious than that for
which Miss Cavell was shot—were
now treated with astonishing tolerance.
Penalties even for flagrant acts of espionage
and defiance of military regulations
were palliated through the mysterious
offices of a woman whose power no one
understood. French by birth, but the
widow of a German officer fallen in
battle, this individual—a sweet-looking,
<i>petite</i> woman of about thirty, neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
remarkable for beauty, force of character,
nor personal magnetism, succeeded in
having many death-penalties revoked, in
liberating a number of civil prisoners
and bending the governmental will, so
long implacable, as she chose.</p>

<p>I made her acquaintance in the little
faubourg house where she dwelt with
her mother and brother, the latter an
artist, both of the same pleasant, rather
provincial and unimposing type as herself.
Her manners and speech, soft and
kindly; her soft, blue, rather childlike
eyes suggested no latent power. One
instance of her mediation, told me by
herself, was that of a man and his daughter
condemned to death for espionage.
Damning evidence of guilt had been
discovered in their possession—drawings
and writings containing important information,
some of which, it was ascertained,
they had smuggled into Holland for
the enemy. And although their death-sentence
had already been given, the
lady of mystery had it changed to imprisonment
and a fine. The punishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
in another case (that of a Belgian youth
caught red-handed attempting to destroy
a train conveying German troops) was
also altered to a milder form of penalty.</p>

<p>While all in Brussels appreciated the
good this young widow accomplished,
they were none the less mystified; many
ridiculous and, in some cases, ungenerous
explanations all equally inadequate were
given. A friend of mine, who was present
while she pleaded before the military
judges, spoke highly of her persuasive
powers and stated she had won her object
by appealing to their <i>humanity</i>! The
case was that of a boy who had been
caught trying to cross the frontier—almost
the very crime for which Edith
Cavell, Philippe Baucq, and others were
condemned to death. She begged them
to consider the anguish of the boy’s
mother, to appreciate the noble patriotism
of his impulse, to put themselves
in his place and ask themselves
if, at his age, they would not have done
the same, and so forth—arguments that
had been uttered in that room a thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
times, enhanced by the tears and agony
of frantic mothers and wives, husbands
and brothers, of those condemned and
never pardoned! Yet this familiar plea,
spoken by one lacking the deep,
heart-torn passion with which it had so
often been vainly uttered, won the boy’s
reprieve! Why? It is difficult for anyone
familiar with the former mercilessness
of that military court to believe
that her softly spoken appeal was alone
responsible. A subtle change was coming
over the spirit of German militarism.
The worlds they had sought to conquer
were fading from view, and anxiety to
save something from the wreck was
probably the root-incentive of their
leniency.</p>

<p>During October 1918 a suppressed,
half-incredulous excitement could be felt
in the very air of Brussels, although
contradictory reports prevented us from
knowing anything definite. Now and
again rumours of thrilling promise would
sweep over the city, but disappointment
had been too frequent, hope too often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
quenched in despair, for the lower classes
to put much faith on them.</p>

<p>“<i>Est-ce vrai?</i>” was their almost invariable
reply to news of encouraging
character, and scarcely any enthusiasm
was shown even by those of superior
station. The dread of a new German rush
forward appeared to haunt the minds
of all, a dread kept alive by the only
journals available and by the confusing
accounts, always favourable to the enemy,
these contained. Even as late as 2nd
October we read that the Germans
had broken through the Belgian lines, a
report given with the old triumphant
bravado. Of the battle between Roulers
and Warvicq it was said the Allies had
failed in their attack: “<i>Les Alliés ont
attaqué sans succès</i>.” Near Cambrai the
Canadians had made a slight advance
costing them frightful losses, but were
driven back on Tilloy by one division of
Würtembergers!</p>

<p>On the same date appeared the following
report: “D’importantes forces
américaines ont attaqué à l’est de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
l’Argonne. Les points ou la bataille a
été la plus chaude ont été de nouveau
Apremont et le bois Montrebeau. Nous
avons repoussé sur toute la ligne l’ennemi,
qui a subi hier de nouvelles et particulièrement
lourdes pertes.” Equally
discouraging accounts were given of the
situation in Italy, Macedonia, and
Palestine—accounts as much at variance
with the Allied communiqués.</p>

<p>Falsification of facts may have been
considered necessary in a critical situation
such as the Central Powers were facing.
Surely, however, they might have spared
the unrelenting efforts to terrify and dishearten
the Belgians, who, locked in
their prison, could not have influenced
the Allies’ determination to bring the
war to an end necessary for the world’s
salvation.</p>

<p>Even when, on the 3rd of October, it
was known in Brussels that Bulgaria had
asked for a separate peace, German
comments robbed the event of all
encouraging significance. It was announced
in our papers that enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
forces had been dispatched to Sofia
which would “settle the Bulgarian difficulties
at one stroke,” and drive the
Allies back whence they had come!
Consequently there was no general
elation over an event of such tremendous
significance to the outside world. We
knew too little of what had led up to it,
and hope had sunk too low to revive.</p>

<p>Although, of course, the ever-approaching
thunder of guns told us much, and
the <i>feu de barrage</i> for weeks roared its
awful tale, the only obvious indications
we had of the vast changes brewing
were the altered sentiment and behaviour
of German soldiers. They occasionally
uttered astounding opinions in regard
to their Government and of sympathy
with Belgium. The poor Belgians, so
long subjected to German trickery, saw
in this merely obedience to plotting chiefs
who hoped thus to overcome their hatred.
No one cut off as we were from outside
news could otherwise understand it;
while the journals presented little else
than vainglorious accounts of Allied reverses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
German submarine victories, and
the bombardment of Paris by long-distance
cannon!</p>

<p>In regard to the last-mentioned outrage,
the feeling in Brussels was no less
bitter than it must have been in France,
and doubtless throughout the entire
world. Our papers presented us daily
with triumphant descriptions of the terror
and devastation caused to the inhabitants
of Paris, even stating that the city
was being generally evacuated. The
Zeppelin had not taught Germany that
her uncivilized methods of war served
merely to create large and indomitable
armies in the opposing nations, once so
little prepared for war and so lacking in
enthusiasm!</p>

<p>By the time our beds were demanded,
and armed men forced their way even
into the poorest homes to rob the cold
and hungry Belgians of their last remnant
of comfort, the change in the soldiers’
sentiments became even more marked.
Beds were taken, often from under the
owners before they had risen in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
morning, but in many cases there was a
noticeable indifference shown by those
who did the looting. The men who
came to our house only took two
mattresses, and made no attempt to
search for wool that was hidden. One
of them expressed very bitterly his distaste
for the duty imposed on him, and
said, among other startling remarks:
“The whole war is an outrage imposed
upon us Germans by our leaders, who
must pay for it some day not far distant”!
Another, whom I met in a shop, told me
that if he had not a wife and little children
in Germany he would never return to
the Vaterland he had been falsely lured
to protect. At mention of the Kaiser, he
exclaimed savagely: “<i>Kaiser!—Ach, der
Kaiser!</i>—Wait until the troops get back
to Germany! There will be an accounting
then!” and drew his finger significantly
across his throat.</p>

<p>It was unspeakably pathetic at this
time to see the war-weary, ill-clad, and
under-fed German troops returning from
the front to Brussels; especially those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
called back to the trenches, after a rest
too brief to revive their strength, or dim
their recollection of horrors endured.
These poor, heavily laden slaves, many so
young, with a look of yearning for home
in their wide, helpless eyes, called for
sympathy despite the wrong they represented.
No voice acclaimed them, as they
strode through a hating city to give up
their lives for a monstrous error; but
many of those who watched forgot, for a
moment, past suffering to express a word
of compassion unheard, alas, by those
columns of desperate human beings—beings
forced back to be massacred on
foreign land, merely for the vanity of their
ruler—merely that the German Kaiser’s
long-cherished and carefully perfected
military toy might avoid the disgrace even
then inevitable! It was galling to better-class
Belgians to note about this time a
certain friendliness developing between
the German soldiers and common people.
At the markets, where soldiers swarmed,
it was no rare sight to see girls hanging to
their arms, and even older women talking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
and joking with them. The reason of this
was not indifference to all that Belgium
had suffered at German hands, but because
to these people the soldiers spoke more
openly. By dint of constant association
they learned that all Germans were not
criminals, that many hundreds of the men
had been ignorant of the true situation—men
who, awaking too late, were conscious
of the injustice done and bitter against
the power that had deceived and enslaved
them.</p>

<p>This recalls a confession made to me,
long before, by a man who had lived in
Belgium for twenty years, but, being still
a German citizen, was called back to the
army at the outbreak of war. When
approaching the Belgian frontier he and
others hesitated, demanding why they
were being led into Belgium, and were
told that France had violated the country’s
neutrality, and the Belgians had called
upon Germany to defend her! Only
when facing Belgian troops, they realized
they had been deceived; and to hesitate
then meant being shot by their own men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Despised as the German race was, and
probably will be for many generations to
come, nevertheless their long-suffering
victims were large-spirited enough to
recognize the worthiness of individuals,
and not hold them responsible for their
nation’s crimes. But better qualities
were shown only by the later troops
brought from Germany to fill vast gaps
in the original army hurled to death <i>en
masse</i> during the first mad effort. These
entered the hideous strife when even
their leaders were beginning to tremble
before the gigantic storm of vengeance
they had roused through the whole civilized
world. And even these probably did
not know the whole of their nation’s guilt.
At least, one tries to believe they did not;
for to think that so great a number of
civilized beings could have continued the
conflict if aware, from the very beginning,
of their leaders’ barbarous devices, would
destroy one’s faith in the stability of
civilization. It seems impossible that
thinking and, more or less, educated men
could countenance the illegitimate aerial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
assaults on English and French towns;
those cowardly and inexcusable air
attacks upon Paris which began in the
very first month of the war and continued,
without mercy, to the end. The glorious
capital of France now presents a mass of
wounds in her very centre—in cherished
localities sacred to all the world, such as
the great cathedral of Notre-Dame, on
which a bomb was dropped as early as
October 1914, before adequate protection
could be prepared! It seems as though
no reasoning mind could be cognizant of
these wrongs without being impressed
with the conviction that right was on the
side of those nations whose courage was
unbroken by mean and unlawful assaults,
viler than history has ever before recorded.
England did not waver, and France did
not waver; every dastardly blow inflicted
by Germany only increased their
righteous wrath; and the armies returning
from the scene where their defeat was
already inevitable were beginning to
realize how justifiable was that wrath.</p>

<p>They had seen thousands upon thousands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
of their fellows brought back
mangled from invaded countries the holding
of which meant nothing to them; had
read the long lists of dead, and began to
wonder what it was all for. On several
occasions I have heard the soldiers ask
that question with a look of puzzled
wonder in their eyes, more eloquent than
the words, “<i>Wofür ist eigentlich die ganze
Sache</i>?”</p>

<p>Can their rulers answer it in a manner
satisfactory to these men? Can they
answer it who, safely removed from
the hell into which they drove them,
continued to cry: “We must go on! We
must fight to our last man rather than
lose an inch of what we have gained!
Victory shall be ours, for God is with
us”? It can only be hoped that the
Almighty whom they blasphemed by that
diabolic decision, will not hold those responsible
who, in blind loyalty, obeyed it
with the sacrifice of their young and
promising lives.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">ON 12th October, President Wilson’s
reply to the German peace plea
was made known to us, and its brief
dignity, its firm, just, and benevolent
strength, stirred every American heart
with pride, and awoke among the Belgians
enthusiasm only kept with difficulty
within the limits their rulers ordained.
Peace then, for the first time, began to
be spoken of as a still vague but now
conceivable possibility. The poor were
eager for it at almost any price—that is, the
uneducated and uncomprehending poor.
The thoughtful wanted it that further
carnage might be checked; but those
whose wounds were too deep for forgetting,
whose life-interest had been buried in
some innocent grave, cried: “They shall
not have peace until they are on their
knees!” And to the argument that such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
satisfaction could only be attained at
cost of Belgium’s total destruction the
unhesitating reply came “<i>Qu’importe?</i>
France has sacrificed her cities, why should
not we? Better see even Brussels razed
to the ground, than not achieve to the
full that aim for which we have already
sacrificed so much!”</p>

<p>Their determination to go on was not
that of Germany, impelled by greed and
pride; but desire to risk all in order to be
rid for ever of an unscrupulous neighbour;
to eradicate the smallest trace of that
neighbour’s control, and see it finally
broken. This, more even than a righteous
and excusable desire for vengeance, was
their reason for wishing to continue a
conflict that had so injured them, while
Germany’s object was merely to avoid
punishment and the loss of her gains!</p>

<p>Those without work, without hope or
ambition, the poor, famished, soup-kitchen
folk, would not believe that the
Germans really wanted peace: “There
is a trick under it; we shall wait and see!”
was all their comment. And it seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
as though theirs was the voice of prophecy
when news of Prince Max von Baden’s
famous and seemingly treacherous letter
reached us. How this affected the outer
world we had no means of judging, but
it caused in Brussels mingled anger and
fear.</p>

<p>In those days the feeling was very high
and enthusiastic for America. “<i>Ce sont
les Américains qui nous out sauvés!</i>”
was the popular sentiment, although
America’s deeds at the front were never
given in our papers. America, according
to the German censorship, was even more
negligible than England; only the French
armies were allowed a certain amount
of credit in regard to the “victorious
alteration of our front” which the
<i>puissances centrales</i> were so often obliged to
acknowledge in those later days. People,
nevertheless, were not so intoxicated by
present events as to forget the first thrilling
days, when Belgium alone held back
that overwhelming tide, and sowed the
seed of the victory now approaching;
nor those later ones when France and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
England so marvellously achieved the
real, the all-important defeat of Prussia
at the Marne. Nor were those still more
terrible days forgotten, following Russia’s
withdrawal—those weeks of anguish when
new hordes of Germans rushed through
Brussels toward the front, and wiped out
all the Allied advances we had been following
so patiently, so eagerly, step by step
over the torn and blood-soaked regions
of France. That period was more appalling
even than that of the first onslaught,
more annihilating to hope. Looking back
on it, recalling the almost crazing tension
of anxiety, the reigning conviction
that Germany was rushing on to conquest,
the second stand before Paris, that wonderful,
all-glorious victory, shines out as
more brilliant, more soul-thrilling, even
than the first. And yet of the imperishable,
recklessly heroic charge of the
American marines before Chateau-Thierry,
that outburst of fresh and determined
energy, which refired the Allies and helped
once and for all to turn the tide of war,
we knew nothing until after the Allied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
troops had entered Brussels. We knew
only that the enemy was stronger both
in numbers and in his determination to
win at any cost, despite the hypocritical
peace offer that gave him excuse to
cry: “You will not have peace on our
terms? Then bear the consequences!”
and to make those consequences—already
prepared—throw into shadow all the
horrors of his first <i>Massenschlacht</i>.</p>

<p>No, glorious England, France, and
Belgium! no plea of overwhelming
numbers, no whine of enforced surrender
before the entire world, can rob you of
laurels won in the first awful years—that
vast, unequalled victory which America’s
generous hand helped at the critical
moment to assure you!</p>

<p>The realization that victory was in sight
came upon us in Brussels with the dazing
suddenness of a comet in a starless night.
The first evidence of Germany’s collapse
was the sudden and astonishing independence
of soldiers toward their superiors.
We wondered at this for a day or two;
then the truth burst on us with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
avalanche of disbanded troops, from the
<i>étape</i> regions, who, flinging off all control,
arrived in groups of twenty, more
or less. No red flag could be seen among
them, nothing explained their strange
advent save their look of desperate weariness.
So quietly they came that at
first everyone believed they were returning
on furlough, bearing with them booty
seized on the way from the houses and
farms of fugitives. Until the time when
their increasing numbers attracted even
the puzzled attention of children, there
was no relaxation of the iron hand.</p>

<p>Even when the red flag of rebellion
was glaring defiance of the Kaiser and
his flatterers, the daily papers offered
us their usual official lies. William the
Second’s “invincible armies” were represented
as still resisting the world; the
Allies had been checked at this point or
that; and the Belgians again were called
upon to consider the dire consequences
to themselves and their country of continuation
of the war. And this when the
war was virtually ended!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>I think, from all evidence, the shock
was as great to the occupying Powers as
to us. They may have been more prepared
than we for disaster, but they
certainly seemed taken by surprise when
that red flag appeared, waving at the
head of their defeated troops.</p>

<p>If the war came like a lightning-stroke,
it went, so far as we could judge, like
a falling star of incalculable speed. Most
of us were too dazed to comprehend the
meaning of events.</p>

<p>Suddenly the pompous officer with shining
helmet, loaded revolver, and dangling
sword, who had reigned supreme in streets,
cafés, and trams, disappeared.</p>

<p>Those were stirring, extraordinary, unprecedented
days! And yet, by remaining
indoors, one might have lived through
the first of them without suspecting
anything unusual. The troops entered
quietly, too contented, apparently, to be
done with past strife to plunge into more.
Numbers of them sought concealment in
Belgium, rather than go back to the discord
they expected at home, openly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
stating they did not wish to return to
Germany. These were not deserters, but
men known to have come direct from the
front. It was a strange experience, and
one of peculiar psychological interest, to
watch these battle-worn men, soiled, weary,
and haggard, crossing the city all with
the same look of internal perplexity, as
though just waking from a nightmare
whose meaning they were trying to solve.
They appeared to have no set purpose,—probably
none, but the leaders had,—nor
did they evince the slightest humiliation
at returning vanquished through conquered
lands. On the contrary, their
attitude toward the people of Brussels
was kindly, almost friendly; they seemed
even to expect applause from the throngs
that gradually gathered to gaze upon
them. Some of those watching would
doubtless have given them a cry of farewell,
in sheer satisfaction at their departure
(if not in compassion for the guiltless
among them), but for the hideous memories
their uniforms evoked. Despite those
memories, a genial or joking word was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
thrown them occasionally from the crowd,
and replied to in the same spirit.</p>

<p>If, even <i>one</i> year earlier, some trustworthy
reader of the future had predicted
such a scene, not one of that gaping
crowd would have considered it possible;
for, as History has never recounted a
conflict so frightful, so it has never seen
so astounding a termination of war, such
a mingling of tragedy and comedy! In
those extraordinary street-scenes humanity
was visibly struggling on the one side
against the follies of tradition, and on the
other against the cruel ache of unforgettable
wounds. The German troops, repentent,
broken, realizing that they had
been fighting for nothing higher than a
pride founded on their enslaved souls,
seemed to crave recognition of their
emancipation—looked for some sign of
pardon and good fellowship from the
people they had obediently ground to
earth.</p>

<p>There were intervals between the passing
of troops, but soldiers in small groups
constantly wandered about looking for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
a resting-place. Nearly every house in
Brussels was obliged to take some of
them in for a day or two—soldiers and
such officers as had decided to throw
their lot in with the revolutionists.
Others, the more aristocratic officers, despisers
of the red flag, fled as best they
could. Occasionally a high-power automobile
tore through the city, bearing
three or four of these outraged gods
toward the German frontier. But
soldiers, with levelled rifles, checked their
course, two of whom mounted the cars,
and, dragging the shining epaulettes from
their superiors’ shoulders, threw them
to the crowd. This done, they stepped
back, quietly replaced their weapons,
and allowed the car to go on. The
officers offered no resistance; though
blanched with rage, they were as helpless
before their armed slaves as Belgium had
been before the massed cannon and diabolic
instruments of destruction.</p>

<p>During the first week after the revolution
became known, a body of higher
officers, with some loyal soldiers, took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
possession of the Gare du Nord, hoping
to prevent the revolutionists making use
of the railway. Had they had a greater
number on their side, this act might
have caused Belgium, besides all her
other trials, to bear the brunt of
Germany’s internal strife. As it was,
many Belgians suffered loss of life and
destruction of property through this selfishly
stupid attempt to defy the avenging
hand. Great throngs of people were in
the streets; and I, with a friend, happened
also to be in that crowded quarter
where the outrage took place. Unwarned
and unsuspecting, we were attracted
thither by an interesting mass of troops,
just returned from the front, with cannon,
mitrailleuse, field-kitchens, and armoured
war-cars. In the joy of freedom from
stern military authority, we all swarmed
as close as possible to these, now apparently
harmless, features of war.</p>

<p>At a certain point on the main boulevard
quite close to the station, one or
two armed soldiers stood ineffectually
warning back the throngs, without explanation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
either too indifferent or too
ignorant themselves to enforce their
orders. Consequently many curious
Belgians drifted past them, some returning
the sentinels’ challenge with laughing
bravado. One guard menaced with
his rifle a couple who attempted to pass,
but in so melodramatic a manner that,
while those threatened fled in terror,
many others slipped by him unperceived.</p>

<p>Then the report of a revolver rang
out, immediately followed by others, and
at the same moment a terrific volley of
mitrailleuse was brutally discharged into
the street, from windows of the station
building—it was said by officers, who cared
little how many civilians might be sacrificed
to their folly. The amazed and terrified
Belgians were driven back like dust
before a hurricane—dazed by the deafening
roar, by the plunging of frantic horses,
the crash of windows on every side, and
the whistle of deadly missiles that filled
the air like a sudden storm of hail,
riddling adjacent houses and felling
many a startled Belgian, with the soldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
it recklessly aimed to destroy. In less
than two moments after the mitrailleuse
opened fire, the street was cleared as by
magic of every living being, save the
troops firing back. Rushing blindly from
a menace so little expected, the people
crowded into shops or fled up side-streets
for protection. Meanwhile the
roar continued until the officers, surprised
by troops (who, I believe, entered the
building unperceived from the rear), were
obliged to capitulate, and the irrational
conflict was brought to an end.</p>

<p>Local skirmishes of more or less serious
character occurred at intervals throughout
the city, during the passage of troops
returning to their chastened Vaterland.
In certain districts bullet-pierced windows
and damaged façades bear witness of
these outbreaks, mostly caused during
an attack upon officers loyal to the
Empire, discovered in their place of
concealment. But, considering the unparalleled
difficulty of the situation,—these
vast armies of enemy troops, flushed
with freedom from autocratic control,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
coming into the midst of a people taught
to despise them,—there was extraordinarily
little discord. The troops, for the
most part, were amiable, taking even
occasional gibes in a good spirit. Only
the officers—those who still remained,
mostly without epaulettes and wearing
a bit of red—appeared to distrust the
Belgians, and were ever on the alert for
attack: the fear of guilty consciences,
apparently quite lacking in the soldier!
I myself saw some who (doubtless in
accordance with von Hindenburg’s suggestion)
stayed to settle up matters pertaining
to the government, etc., carrying
hand-grenades as they moved about the
streets—weapons they could hurl into
the midst of that massed attack they
seemed to dread!</p>

<p>While standing, one day, at the Porte
de Namur watching a battered regiment
pass by on its slow, foot-weary way to
Liège and Germany, I was amazed to
hear what an amount of good-natured
taunting they received from the crowd,
not only without resentment, but often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
with responsive levity. One man near
me cried out in Flemish: “They are
bound to get to Paris, but have decided
the shorter and best route is by way of
Berlin!”</p>

<p>“<i>Ja, ja!</i>” returned laughingly a
haggard-faced youth seated on a cannon-wagon,
“<i>Sie haben recht!</i> the road to
Berlin is the best of all roads!”</p>

<p>Another man in the crowd took a toy
cannon from his pocket, and pointing it
at a passing line of soldiers, cried: “Attention!
The British are coming!” And
to the amazement, I think, of most
persons present, he was answered by the
troops with a roar of spontaneous laughter.</p>

<p>Some scenes presented by the retreat
of Germany’s disillusioned and crest-fallen
army were pitiful enough to bring
tears to the eyes of their bitterest enemies.
Often small detachments passed through,
not in line, but trudging along as best
they could under heavy burdens—probably
the sorry remnants of once-proud regiments.
These had no commander and
evidently no interest save the one fixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
purpose to get back to their homes. They
carried their belongings either on their
backs, or in heavy carts which they
dragged along, four or five together
straining at the ropes. These cumbrous
country carts, probably bought or stolen
from peasants, were piled high with bulging
knapsacks, boxes, French and English
helmets, and other trophies of the battlefield.
And, in strange contrast to these,
were bits of furniture, coops containing
live hens, and often a cow or two tethered
behind.</p>

<p>Travel-worn peddlers could not have
been more indifferent than these men
to public observation. Ill-clad and ill-nourished,
they gazed straight ahead,
hungering for their wives and children;
taking as little interest in the revolution
as they did in the Kaiser; trying to
forget what they had gone through—plodding
along like animals, without hope
of reward or acclamation for all they had
courageously endured.</p>

<p>I saw one soldier, an elderly man whose
uniform was almost in tatters, and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
boots so worn they must have been
painful to walk in, trudging alone along
one of the main boulevards, leading a
very small donkey attached to a cart in
which were the treasures he was taking
home. On top of all was a wooden
cage containing live rabbits. He paid
no attention to the amusement his appearance
aroused in the onlookers, and,
appearing to have forgotten he had ever
pertained to a regiment, saw nothing but
the long way ahead, toward the goal of
his one absorbing desire—<i>Heimat</i>!</p>

<p>Later on, the troops strode through
in regimental order under command of
revolutionary leaders, but bearing, even
then, little resemblance to the brilliant
legions that had marched so haughtily
through Brussels on the 20th of August
1914. The great monster had even then
met its master on the banks of the Marne;
but it refused to recognize the fact, or
sacrifice Imperial pride in order to save
the brave sons of the then prosperous
nation: it threw palpitating, living hearts
of those sons to the cannon, until a latent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
human instinct of self-preservation was
awakened in them. Then those who survived
understood, at last, that their real
enemy was not behind those determined
and avenging guns; but at home, seated
upon the throne of despotism.</p>

<p>“Oh what a fall was there!” Not of
a Cæsar deserving the eulogies of a
Marcus Antonius, but the dignity of a
nation worthy a nobler leader—diligent,
prosperous, sober-minded Germany.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">NO sooner did the Belgians know
that the occupying government
had fallen, than their long-hidden, beloved
tricolour appeared. Revolutionary
leaders, fearing this might cause trouble,
asked those now in authority to have
the colours removed, and the people were
requested to withdraw them, until one appeared
on the Hôtel de Ville. This was
accordingly done in the more important
thoroughfares, but in others the flag
continued to float above the moving
streams of enemy forces, who showed
no resentment. On the contrary, they
seemed to admire the daring patriotism
it expressed; and on one occasion, to my
knowledge, German troops marched under
those flags through the Chaussée d’Ixelles
singing the Marseillaise!</p>

<p>In the eyes of the more intelligent one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>

<p>The extraordinary spirit of reconciliation
shown by these men, their total lack
of humiliation in defeat, was in such
strange contrast to the confident pride
with which they had originally invaded
Belgium that it was difficult to believe
one’s eyes. And in their individual self-control,
in the genial smile with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
they met the rabble’s taunts, was a more
beautiful pride than before—the pride
of awakened conscience, and of that
innate moral force which, despite aristocratic
plottings, had before the war raised
Germany to a foremost place among
nations; which will no doubt raise her
again, like a phœnix, from the ashes of
her errors.</p>

<p>However, there were also dark, familiar
stains to mar this dawning of a new
Germany whose sun, by a strange irony
of Fate, arose in Belgium! The yesterday
of trickery and terrorism in certain members
of that vast host still survived the
night of defeat. Soldiers, by force of
arms, committed daring thefts throughout
the country, mostly to obtain money,
of which the troops seemed in great
need—must indeed have been, since some
sold their weapons, bed-covers, and even
their clothing. One day I heard a young
under-officer bartering his boots with a
café <i>garçon</i> for fifty francs, when shoes
of any sort, at the time, could not be had
for less than a hundred, or even more.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Another evidence of this need, and one of
enlightening significance, was the reckless
sale of goods which they held in outlying
districts of Brussels. At Forest and other
suburban parts of the city, great car-loads
of material, looted from shops and private
houses probably months or years ago,—for
the dry-goods shops of Brussels had
been cleaned out quite two years before,—were
offered at absurdly trivial prices.
Silk-velvet, which could not be had in
Brussels for less than two hundred francs,
went at a mark a yard; warm woollen
stuffs, which the shivering population,
thinly clad in dyed cotton, could not
obtain at any price in the shops, were
sold—to such as deigned to buy—for
an equally small sum. All these goods,
taken on pretence of clothing the army—or
<i>Belgian prisoners</i>!—were brought to
light again, and not only stuffs, but all
manner of other things, as if from some
pirates’ cave, were bartered back to those
who had been robbed of them.</p>

<p>But now thieving became more bold;
not by officers, but by soldiers, who did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
not attempt to disguise it with transparent
lies.</p>

<p>In some cases, nevertheless, that old
trick was still tried, as in that of a prominent
banker, who was robbed of one
hundred and twenty-five thousand francs
by six soldiers. Evidently familiar with
banking affairs, they presented themselves
at his office after business hours, and,
finding him alone with one employé,
coolly demanded the sum desired. The
characteristic Teuton excuse was not
wanting—characteristic in its absurdity:
Belgians <i>might</i> rob the army <i>en route</i>!—unarmed
Belgians might loot the German
vans, under guard of many hundreds of
armed soldiers!—therefore large sums
were demanded from all banks as guarantee!</p>

<p>The banker stated that he was unable
to grant their demand, as there was no
money available in the bank. But even
as he spoke two <i>encaisseurs</i> entered;
their satchels, containing the amount
mentioned, were seized, the contents
quietly appropriated, and the soldiers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
revolver in hand, retired. The banker
appealed to the revolutionary chiefs, who
refused to credit his story, stating proudly
that “Germans were not thieves.” But
by dint of perseverance, and many visits,
he at last convinced them, and the money
was returned to him, from army funds,
just one hour before these high-minded
leaders were, for some reason unknown
to us, thrown out of power.</p>

<p>Another instance of the justice which
these unfortunately displaced chiefs endeavoured
to exercise, was the punishment
of a German soldier, who, convicted of
having murderously assaulted the woman
cashier of a restaurant and stolen the
contents of her <i>caisse</i>, was placed against
a wall and shot—or so we were told.</p>

<p>The shocking original methods of German
troops, in regard to places they
inhabited, were also revived in these days.
At one private hotel with whose proprietor
we were well acquainted, their
behaviour was almost beyond belief. The
hotel had been requisitioned, and occupied
during the war by German women, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
left it in good condition. But the troops,
who afterwards took possession for a few
days only on their way out, reduced it to
a state of uncivilized filth and wanton
destruction, committing unmentionable
acts whereby the up-to-date and valuable
kitchen utensils, the flower-pots, and even
the drawers of bureaus were rendered
unfit for future service. Bombs were
found under some of the beds, and the
whole place had to be taken over by the
State to be cleansed and examined.</p>

<p>Brussels, during that time, echoed day
and night to spasmodic reports of firearms,
sometimes of considerable duration,
and consequently terrifying; at others
merely an inexplicable exchange of shots.</p>

<p>But on Saturday the 16th and Sunday
the 17th of November, the entire city
trembled to blast after blast of cannon,
and the shuddering shock of car-loads of
ammunition set off in merciless proximity
to inhabited quarters. The numerous
mines buried in and about the city were
also exploded—those treacherous death-traps
awaiting the Allied armies, on which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the occupying government had founded
its boast that Brussels would be the
“bouquet of the whole war,” a prediction
constantly repeated.</p>

<p>While public attention was more or less
centred on these continued explosions,
fires broke out in all the railway stations,
one of which was almost entirely destroyed.
Many explanations were set afloat in the
familiar German fashion, the most persistent
being that rue Haute thieves had
done it in order to pillage certain cars—an
absurd suggestion, since thieves do not
usually light a beacon to attract attention
to their deeds. One damning fact, moreover—the
simultaneity of the conflagrations—suggested
some inexplicable Teuton
object, perhaps mere vengeance.</p>

<p>The theory of vengeance was given
weight by an account given us by the
mayor of Charleroi. Just before the Germans
withdrew, some officers visited him
and, without giving a hint of their intentions,
asked him to call together all the
former Belgian railroad employés and
send them to work at the station. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
mayor, considering this a reasonable request,
willingly agreed, got the men
together, and set them to work. Scarcely
were they all gathered in and about the
station than terrific explosions took place
in the yard and on near-by tracks. Fifty-eight
of the unsuspecting Belgians were
killed, and many others, living in the
vicinity, either slain or wounded, while
every window in the entire town was
shattered, doors also and many objects of
value. Hundreds of cars containing ammunition
had been secretly attached by
a fuse wire, which the Germans lighted
and left to do its deadly work, while they
fled into safety and were never again
seen.</p>

<p>Some intrepid Belgians, fortunately,
discovered the fuse, cut it, and thus saved
two hundred and twenty car-loads of
high-power explosives, some of which
stood in the centre of the town and would
have caused its entire wreckage.</p>

<p>The mayor also told us a shocking story
in regard to a hospital in his town which
the Germans had occupied during the war.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
At their departure they removed their
wounded, and announced that the hospital
was at his disposal. On going to visit
it, he found a number of French and
English wounded lying on the floor, who
stated they had never had a bed, and
were in a deplorable condition. Outside,
in the ambulance garage, the door of
which was locked, he found seventeen
dead bodies of soldiers, entirely devoid
of clothing and therefore impossible to
identify as to nationality. In a corner
of this place were heaped a ghastly collection
of amputated human limbs. These
and the bodies were in a state of decomposition
that rendered their removal both
dangerous and horrible.</p>

<p>A school-house that had been used to
shelter troops up to the last day before
the Germans left, he found in a condition
quite as incredibly revolting. There were
no beds; the floors, covered with a sort
of mossy turf, were in a state of indescribable
filth, whereon the soldiers slept and
which they subjected to animal-like treatment.
The stench, he said, was frightful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
and the entire place so infected with
vermin that the charwomen engaged to
clean it were not allowed to leave the
premises before being thoroughly fumigated
and cleansed.</p>

<p>After such disclosures, could one wonder
at the brutalized, unhuman appearance of
those men who dragged their weary way
through Brussels—men once hardy, self-respecting
tillers of the soil, or workers
in other useful pursuits? Such treatment
as they had endured could leave no spark
of military pride in them, no consciousness
of shame at defeat, no desire even
for the triumph of victory.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 17th of November,
when Germans were seen openly in the
capital for the last time, the street scenes
were something at which to marvel.
Everyone was abroad. Among the throng
surging to and fro, through those wide
avenues and boulevards so long ruled
by the enemy, the familiar grey-green
Teuton uniforms were relieved by the
khaki of the English and Belgians, and
the pale blue of the French. Many Italians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
and Russians were there, and one or two
American airmen who had descended
from a cloudless sky to see how the
armistice was affecting us. Although no
organized part of the Allied armies had
yet entered save certain Belgians on leave
to visit their families, hundreds of liberated
prisoners had come to the city from
German camps where they had been forced
to labour for the enemy. All of these
save the French, who could speak the
language, were a sorry-looking lot, wandering
about, unable to express themselves.
So numerous were they that it was impossible
for the Belgians to collect them
at once and give them the assistance and
comfort which they so greatly needed.
The British prisoners especially were
pitiable to behold in their starved condition
and wretched rags—poor helpless
youths, that for many months had endured
such moral and physical anguish under
their cruel jailers that some stated they
had looked back with regret to their life
in the trenches.</p>

<p>Most of these had found kind hearts to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
look after them, before that amazing
Sunday when foe and friend mingled
in the streets of Brussels, presenting a
sight so fantastic, so unforeseen, that it
seemed to lend a strange element of
travesty to all that had gone before.</p>

<p>On the crowded platforms of trams an
occasional German might be seen, pressed
close to a haggard-looking Britisher worn
to emaciation after months of harsh
treatment by the former’s compatriots;
or shoulder to shoulder with a jubilant
Belgian officer, hearing his response to
the triumphant greeting of friends—hearing
the wild applause given to units of all
the Allied nations! Strange and incredible
sight, in those streets where the
<i>casque à pointe</i> had reigned supreme but
a few days before, where—it seemed but
yesterday—the hope of seeing a Belgian,
English, or French uniform had been
almost extinguished!</p>

<p>And now the spiked helmet was ignored.
No voice was raised to acclaim it; the
once-dreaded uniform passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>So far as I know, however, there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
no serious outbreak or obvious resentment
of conditions doubtless sorely trying
to those men of defeated Germany, denied
even the prospect of joyous welcome
in their own country, already seething
with civil strife. German soldiers—even
German officers, whose rank could no
longer be discerned, came face to face
with surly, dark-browed Russians, and
exchanged curious glances, as though furtively
trying to read one another’s minds;
with Italians, whose eyes twinkled with
the satisfaction their impulsive natures
were less able to conceal; with French,
beginning to forget, in the joy of victory,
the wrongs of their prison camps; and
with British, into whose haggard faces
they dared not look!</p>

<p>Even the knowledge of having discarded
the Imperial yoke could not have lessened
the pangs these men must have suffered,
or blinded even the dullest of them to
the evidence afforded by those units
of wronged nations of a punishment too
awful and complete to be attributed to
mortal power alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Especially galling to them must have
been the intense enthusiasm shown by
the population for every Britisher. These,
at the time, only wretched-looking
prisoners, were the first Allies who appeared,
and the sight of them sent the
people into a frenzy of pride, excitement,
and sympathy. Here and there, in the
newly enlivened streets, would be seen a
black swarm of Belgians gathered about
one pitiably emaciated English lad, trying,
without knowing a word of the language,
to find some place of refuge to which he
had been directed by the Belgian committee
who looked after the prisoners.
There was nothing, as a rule, to denote
his nationality, save his speech, and a
ragged khaki jacket, with his prison
number painted on the back. In his
poor, dazed face—made more haggard by
several weeks’ growth of beard—in the
filthiness of his whole appearance, there
was little to denote the bath-loving Englishman.
Some told me they had not
changed their shirts during eight months
of imprisonment; had been forced to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
hard labour, with nothing to eat but
turnip soup, and one loaf of bread a day
shared by four men.</p>

<p>The Belgians, however, quickly took
them in hand, fitted them out with clean
clothes, and at times carried them on
their shoulders through the streets, shouting,
“<i>Vive l’Angleterre!</i>” right under the
noses of the Germans.</p>

<p>All of those to whom I spoke had been
captured at a certain point near Armentières,
where, owing to the collapse of an
adjacent Portuguese trench, the Germans
had got behind them and so cut them off.
They were rather bitter regarding the
“Pork and Beans,” as they called the
Portuguese, and stated with contempt that
they had seen some of the latter, after
their capitulation, pass into the German
lines with hand-satchels, containing their
belongings already packed!</p>

<p>On Monday, the 18th of November,
scarcely two weeks after the first definite
gleam of approaching deliverance penetrated
the prison city, we realized with a
strange, half-incredulous amazement that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
we were free! The grey uniform had
disappeared; those of our deliverers were
in view, and the outer world was once
more a living reality! It seemed impossible—or
rather like awaking abruptly
from a hideous dream! No more roaring
of cannon beyond the patient, proudly
soaring trees of the Bois—where sad gaps
bear witness of the vandal’s hand; no
more racking thunder of mitrailleuse from
the military exercise-field, or droning of
German aeroplanes over our heads; no
more dread of armed soldiers intruding
upon our privacy, or of tyrannical
<i>affiches</i> imposing penalties and checking
liberty! We could go forth into the
free streets without fear of the <i>polizei</i>.
We could walk by lamplight at night,
instead of inky darkness, and take from
our windows the ugly blue paper or dark
curtains by which the dim light of our
houses was hooded. The door-bell could
ring without causing panic, without forcing
me, and others who plied the pen in
secret, to rush off and conceal perilous
manuscripts even before knowing who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
might be at the door. Buried treasures
could be unearthed—newspapers read—letters
written—we could breathe normally
once more! Over four years of
persecution, isolation, and association with
misery, had led in a few days, as it seemed,
to this intoxicating hour of triumph, when
not only the victory we craved was
attained, but the malignant world-menacing
monster, vanquished by the sword of
Justice, had, like a wounded scorpion,
writhing in its pain, stung itself to death!</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">ON Friday, the 22nd of November,
Brussels fulfilled the German prophecy
in a manner little expected by those
who made it, for the city really appeared
the “bouquet of the war,” a radiant,
triumphant, glorious bouquet! Victories
have been, and victories may be again,
but never in all history has a capital
rebounded from long suppression under
such brilliant, unexampled, and ravishing
conditions. As though the Power ruling
heaven were in sympathy with her deliverance,
a sky of Italian-like beauty canopied
the day—the first really blue and cloudless
sky we had seen for months—the
air was crisp and transparent, the sun
glorious. From every window, every
balcony, floated the colours of the Allies:
Belgian, English, French, Italian, Russian,
Japanese, and the “stars and stripes.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Many of these flags were home-made;
sheets dyed and put together with feverish
haste, for materials of all sorts were long
since exhausted in Belgium, and the flags
available were sold at a price beyond the
means of most people. A German merchant
of Bonn, with the opportunist
cleverness of his race, had prepared a vast
number of Allied flags, in time to meet,
more or less, the eager demand all through
Belgium. But (a fact which suggests the
enterprising Teuton must have formed
his scheme before America came in) there
was a great dearth of American flags.
These, consequently, being mostly home-made,
were sometimes rather woeful
imitations of the great banner, for their
colours ran together lamentably during
later days of rain.</p>

<p>Mention of the flag-making German
recalls a significant incident which occurred
in the first year of war, when quantities
of toys, all made to appeal strongly to
Belgian sentiments, and said to have come
from Nuremberg, appeared for sale in
Brussels at Christmas-time. Among these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
expensive playthings were regiments of
lead German soldiers in the act of surrender
to their enemies, with hands uplifted
as depicted in the Allied reports
after the Marne! These drew many
buyers, but the crowds that gathered
about them finally attracted official attention,
whereupon the toys were confiscated,
while the shop which sold them was
forced to close and subjected to a heavy
fine.</p>

<p>But to return to the flags; on this glad
day even the poorest had their banners
prepared in time to welcome their heroic
King, and multitudes gathered to acclaim
his glorious return. All work ceased;
even the tramway employés, important
as were their services on such a day,
refused large bribes rather than forgo
a personal view of the wondrous scene—and
no one could blame them! As
there were no horses nor vehicles to be
had, the stoppage of trams made matters
difficult for those living at a distance.
But they walked, some nearly all night,
in order to secure points of view in those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
localities through which the King was
to pass with his cortège of troops. Such
crowds I have never seen; they were as
impassable as a stone wall in the streets;
packed close on church steps, on the
cornices of buildings, on trees, at windows,
on the roofs. It was a day never before
known, a day never likely to return.</p>

<p>It must be owned that the vocal enthusiasm
was considerably less than one, an
American especially, could have expected.
The cries at first were rather brief and spasmodic,
the waving of handkerchiefs and
so forth more the exception than the rule.
There was none of that mad acclamation
which would have welcomed, or rather
will welcome, returning troops in America,
none of the frenzied excitement with
which we had seen French troops applauded
when departing from Paris.</p>

<p>The reason of this, no doubt, was the
people’s inability to grasp an event in
such tremendous contrast to the four
years’ sorrow which had eaten into their
very souls. They had, so to speak, forgotten
the meaning of joy—were too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
much dazed and overwhelmed by indefinable
emotion to express themselves
adequately.</p>

<p>However, when King Albert appeared,
riding, and beside him his young wife—who
looked rather worn after her hospital
labours—tremendous acclamations arose
from the massed crowds. These were
repeated for Mayor Max, just returned
from imprisonment, and for General
Leman, the hero of Liège. Then, after
a brief pause, the acclamations rose again
to salute the American troops,—which
were honoured with first place behind the
royal cortège,—the British, French, and
Belgians. Over these last brave legions enthusiasm
was shown rather than uttered;
emotion seemed to check the cries, as
though the vast throngs were holding
their breath. Then, after a moment of
extraordinary silence, there was a universal
electric movement, as though that mighty
crowd longed to embrace them as one
man.</p>

<p>The people could scarcely be held back
from breaking the lines of troops. Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
women, with scranny, bare arms uplifted,
ran forward to touch them lovingly;
men white with emotion, sweethearts and
wives, reckless of danger, almost threw
the procession into confusion by their
eagerness to be recognized, or exchange a
word with the brave heroes returning
from a hell such as they probably never
expected to survive.</p>

<p>That night the city was in delirium;
the streets were a throbbing mass of joy-drunken
beings such as was never seen
before. No madness of carnival could
approach the hysterical excitement of
the people in streets illuminated for the
first time in two years; in the cafés, where
the almost forgotten sparkle of champagne
gleamed in glasses raised to the cries
“<i>Vive la Belgique! Vive le Roi! Vivent
les Alliés!</i>” All through the main boulevards,
shouting, singing, and laughing
groups were to be seen dancing in large
circles, hand-in-hand, about an English,
French, or other Allied prisoner who had
drunk so many glasses of triumph he was
generally seated on the ground, or standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
unsteadily, his hollow eyes staring in a
dazed but contented fashion from a face
somewhat pale and thin.</p>

<p>In these groups all the Allied nations
were blended with merry girls and boys
giving vent to long-suppressed spirits.
The Scotch lads, with their bare legs, flying
cap-ribbons, and kilts, gave a delightfully
comic touch, and added to the magic
dream-effect of the whole. They were
the cynosure of all eyes, the <i>pièce de
résistance</i> of the foreign element. When
their troops passed during the royal procession,
with bag-pipes in full voice, there
was a lull of astonished wonder and
interest, followed by a simultaneous outburst
of acclamation. And that interest
and admiration did not wane in the evening;
crowds thronged about them, girls
clung to them,—and at times the latter
exhibited rather improper curiosity with
regard to their “skirts.”</p>

<p>Now and again automobiles, once so
rare a sight in Brussels, forced the dancers
apart for a moment, as a swift skiff might
separate bright-coloured dragon-flies dancing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
above the still surface of a lake,
only that they may unite with more vim
after its passing. In one of these cars,
most of which were military, a party of
young American officers with their friends
were making a tour of the city after a gay
supper, during which some twelve of them
had sung in full, clear voices all the beautiful
and original songs of their nation,
much to the hearers’ delight. At the
head of the car floated a large American
flag, borrowed from the café where they
had regaled themselves. That flag was
greeted with continual outbursts of applause,
especially as one of the party,
a man with the voice of a ship’s siren,
startled even the reigning hubbub with
shouts of “<i>Vive la Belgique! Vive le
Roi! Vive la Liberté!</i>” Hundreds of
voices at once responded, screaming almost
hysterically, “<i>Vive l’Amérique!</i>” “<i>Vive
Wilson!</i>”—and, as though the two
English-speaking nations were indissolubly
united in the public mind, almost
every response was accompanied by “<i>Vive
l’Angleterre!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Allemande</i> and the <i>casque à pointe</i> were
forgotten. The Kaiser’s black shadow
had fled before the glorious angel of a
liberty crowned with the fairest laurels
ever gathered from the bloody fields of
battle—laurels flowering with noble loyalty
and jewelled with imperishable fame.</p>

<p>And, but a little way beyond the borders
of joyous Belgium—hiding from the rage
not only of those whom he had made his
foes, but from that of his own people and
his own allies, lurked the man who had
boasted that he would subjugate an advanced
and prosperous world with his
“iron fist”!</p>

<p>William the Second, original promoter,
if not sole author, of history’s most appalling
crime, cowered in Holland, bereft of
sceptre and throne, muttering perhaps
what Milton put into the mouth of that
other great Enemy of earth: “Which way
I fly is Hell—myself am Hell!”</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
